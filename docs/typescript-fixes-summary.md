# TypeScript Configuration Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Module Resolution Error for Tailwind CSS
**Problem**: Both `apps/console` and `apps/landing` were showing errors importing Tailwind CSS types:
```
Cannot find module 'tailwindcss' or its corresponding type declarations.
There are types at '.../node_modules/tailwindcss/dist/lib.d.mts', but this result could not be resolved under your current 'moduleResolution' setting.
```

**Solution**: Updated `packages/config/tsconfig.base.json` to use modern module resolution:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  }
}
```

### 2. Empty TypeScript Config in apps/app
**Problem**: TypeScript reported no input files found in `apps/app/tsconfig.json`.

**Solution**: 
- Removed leftover `apps/web` directory that was causing confusion
- Verified `apps/app` has all necessary files including `next-env.d.ts`

### 3. Missing Database Package
**Problem**: Console app was trying to import `@repo/database` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Removed the non-existent database package from:
- `apps/console/package.json` dependencies
- `apps/console/next.config.ts` transpilePackages

## Changes Made

1. **Updated TypeScript Base Configuration** (`packages/config/tsconfig.base.json`):
   - Changed `moduleResolution` from "node" to "bundler"
   - Added `module: "ESNext"` to support bundler resolution

2. **Cleaned Up Directory Structure**:
   - Removed leftover `apps/web` directory
   - Ensured `apps/app` is properly structured

3. **Fixed Console App Dependencies**:
   - Removed `@repo/database` from dependencies
   - Updated Next.js config to match

4. **Reinstalled Dependencies**:
   - Ran `npm install` to ensure all packages are properly linked

## Verification

After these changes:
- TypeScript errors for Tailwind imports should be resolved
- The apps/app directory should be recognized properly
- All dependencies should install without errors

## Next Steps

1. Restart your TypeScript language server in VS Code:
   - Command Palette (Cmd+Shift+P) â†’ "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"

2. If any errors persist, try:
   - Clearing Next.js build cache: `rm -rf apps/*/next`
   - Rebuilding TypeScript info: `npm run type-check`
