# Monorepo Restructure - Final Summary

## âœ… All Tasks Completed Successfully!

### What We Accomplished:

1. **Migrated from pnpm to npm** (required for genkit compatibility)
   - Deleted pnpm-workspace.yaml and pnpm-lock.yaml
   - Updated root package.json with npm workspaces configuration
   - Changed packageManager to npm@10.2.4

2. **Restructured the monorepo** for better clarity
   - Renamed `apps/app` â†’ `apps/web`
   - Removed unnecessary `src/` directory layer
   - Now have a cleaner structure: `apps/web/app`, `apps/web/components`, etc.

3. **Updated all configurations**
   - Package names: `@repo/app` â†’ `@repo/web`
   - TypeScript paths: `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` â†’ `"@/*": ["./*"]`
   - Workspace protocols: `"workspace:*"` â†’ `"*"` (npm compatibility)

4. **Created 5 logical commits** (consolidated from planned 6):
   - `15fc10766` - chore: migrate from pnpm to npm workspaces
   - `414d886ac` - refactor: rename apps/app to apps/web for clarity
   - `48ef5a982` - chore: update package names and workspace protocols for npm
   - `5595fa9bf` - chore: add npm lockfile
   - `616039834` - docs: add monorepo restructure documentation

5. **Pushed to remote** and ready for PR
   - Branch: `refactor/monorepo-structure`
   - PR URL: https://github.com/Ty-Robb/mustard/pull/new/refactor/monorepo-structure

### Benefits of the New Structure:

- âœ… **Cleaner paths**: No more `apps/app/src/` redundancy
- âœ… **Better naming**: `apps/web` clearly indicates the web application
- âœ… **npm compatibility**: Works with genkit and other npm-only tools
- âœ… **Scalable**: Ready to add more apps (mobile, desktop, etc.)
- âœ… **Standard monorepo**: Follows common patterns used by Next.js, Vercel, etc.

### Next Steps:

1. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
2. Review the changes
3. Merge to main branch
4. Update any CI/CD configurations if needed
5. Notify team members about the new structure

The monorepo is now properly structured and ready for future growth! ðŸŽ‰
