# Monorepo Restructuring - Complete âœ…

## Date: 06/09/2025
## Branch: refactor/monorepo-structure

## Summary
Successfully restructured the monorepo with the following improvements:
- âœ… Renamed `apps/app` to `apps/web` for better clarity
- âœ… Removed unnecessary `src/` directory layer
- âœ… Migrated from pnpm to npm for genkit compatibility
- âœ… Updated all configurations and dependencies
- âœ… Development server running successfully

## Verification Results
- **npm install**: Successfully installed 1112 packages
- **Dev server**: Running on http://localhost:9001
- **Structure**: Clean, follows Turborepo best practices

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Directory Structure
```
Before:                    After:
apps/app/src/app/    â†’    apps/web/app/
apps/app/src/lib/    â†’    apps/web/lib/
apps/app/src/...     â†’    apps/web/...
```

### 2. Package Manager
- Removed: `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- Added: npm workspaces in root `package.json`
- Created: `package-lock.json`

### 3. Configuration Updates
- `apps/web/package.json`: Name changed to `@repo/web`
- `apps/web/tsconfig.json`: Path alias updated to `"@/*": ["./*"]`
- Script paths updated to remove `src/` prefix
- Workspace protocol changed from `workspace:*` to `*`

## Next Steps
1. Test all functionality in the development environment
2. Run `npm run build` to verify production build
3. Update any CI/CD pipelines that reference old paths
4. Commit all changes
5. Create and merge PR

## Git Commands to Finalize
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "refactor: restructure monorepo - rename app to web, remove src layer, migrate to npm"

# Push to remote
git push origin refactor/monorepo-structure

# Create PR on GitHub
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Cleaner Structure**: Less nesting, more intuitive
2. **Better Naming**: `web` clearly indicates the main web application
3. **Genkit Compatibility**: Using npm ensures all tools work correctly
4. **Future Ready**: Structure supports adding more apps (admin, mobile, etc.)
5. **Best Practices**: Follows Turborepo conventions

The restructuring is complete and the application is running successfully! ðŸŽ‰
