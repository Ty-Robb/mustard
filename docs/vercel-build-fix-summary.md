# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Resolution Error
**Problem**: `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` couldn't be resolved during the build
- The package is an ESM module that requires specific TypeScript configuration
- The dependency wasn't properly hoisted after the pnpm to npm migration

**Solution**:
- Added `@t3-oss/env-nextjs` directly to `apps/web/package.json` dependencies
- Updated `moduleResolution` to `"bundler"` in both:
  - `packages/payments/tsconfig.json`
  - `apps/web/tsconfig.json`

### 2. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: Turborepo was warning about environment variables not being declared
- Variables were set in Vercel but not declared in `turbo.json`

**Solution**:
- Added all required environment variables to the build task in `turbo.json`:
  ```json
  "env": [
    "FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT",
    "MONGODB_URI",
    "BIBLE_API_KEY",
    "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID",
    "GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION",
    "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS",
    "GEMINI_API_KEY",
    "SENTRY_DSN",
    "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY",
    "STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    "GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY",
    "GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID",
    "NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY"
  ]
  ```

## Files Modified
1. `turbo.json` - Added environment variables
2. `apps/web/package.json` - Added @t3-oss/env-nextjs dependency
3. `apps/web/tsconfig.json` - Updated moduleResolution to bundler
4. `packages/payments/tsconfig.json` - Updated to use bundler resolution
5. `package-lock.json` - Updated with new dependency

## Build Status
✅ Local build completed successfully
✅ All changes committed and pushed to `refactor/monorepo-structure` branch
✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

The Vercel build should now succeed with these fixes in place.
