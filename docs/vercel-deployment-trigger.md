# Vercel Deployment Trigger

This file is created to trigger a new Vercel deployment with the latest commits.

## Issue:
Vercel was building from commit `50e0a537` which didn't include the type conflict fix.

## Solution:
The fix for `BibleSearchResult` â†’ `BibleVectorSearchResult` is already in the codebase.
This commit will trigger Vercel to rebuild with the latest code.
