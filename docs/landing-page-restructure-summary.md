## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Install dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all packages
2. **Test builds**: 
   - `npm run build --workspace=@repo/landing`
   - `npm run build --workspace=@repo/app`
3. **Update deployment configurations** for Vercel:
   - Configure landing app deployment
   - Update app deployment settings

### Follow-up Polish Items (from roadmap)
1. **Landing Page Enhancements**:
   - Add actual screenshots/images
   - Implement pricing section
   - Add testimonials
   - SEO optimization
   - Performance optimization

2. **App Polish** (P0 priorities):
   - Connect dashboard stats to real data
   - Fix mobile responsiveness
   - Implement proper loading states
   - Add error handling

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Marketing site vs. application
2. **Performance**: Lighter bundles for each use case
3. **Deployment Flexibility**: Can deploy and scale independently
4. **Development Speed**: Teams can work on landing/app separately
5. **SEO Optimization**: Landing page can be optimized for search without auth concerns

## Commands for Development

# Install all dependencies
npm install

# Run landing page in development

# Run main app in development
npm run dev --workspace=@repo/app

# Build everything
