# Console App Setup Summary

## Overview

Created a new console app for internal team management at `apps/console`. This app is designed to be used by the Mustard team to manage users, view analytics, moderate content, and monitor system health.

## What Was Created

### 1. Console App Structure (`apps/console`)

```
apps/console/
├── package.json          # Dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── next.config.ts        # Next.js configuration
├── tailwind.config.ts    # Tailwind CSS configuration
├── postcss.config.mjs    # PostCSS configuration
├── .gitignore           # Git ignore rules
└── app/
    ├── globals.css      # Global styles with console-specific CSS
    ├── layout.tsx       # Root layout
    └── page.tsx         # Dashboard page with placeholder content
```

### 2. Key Features Implemented

- **Dashboard Layout**: Clean, professional interface with navigation header
- **Stats Cards**: Display key metrics (users, revenue, growth rate)
- **Recent Activity Feed**: Shows system events and user actions
- **System Status Monitor**: Real-time status of various services
- **Quick Actions**: Buttons for common administrative tasks
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layout

### 3. Console-Specific Styling

Added custom CSS classes in `globals.css`:
- `.console-grid`, `.console-sidebar`, `.console-main` - Layout structure
- `.data-table` - Table styling
- `.chart-container` - Chart wrapper
- `.badge` variants - Status indicators (success, warning, error, info)

## Next Steps

### 1. Authentication Setup
- [ ] Implement team-only authentication using NextAuth
- [ ] Create login page at `/login`
- [ ] Add role-based access control (Admin, Moderator, Support)
- [ ] Implement session management

### 2. Create Additional Pages
- [ ] `/users` - User management with search, filter, and actions
- [ ] `/analytics` - Detailed analytics with charts
- [ ] `/content` - Content moderation interface
- [ ] `/settings` - System configuration

### 3. API Integration
- [ ] Connect dashboard stats to real database
- [ ] Implement user management APIs
- [ ] Add analytics data endpoints
- [ ] Create audit logging system

### 4. Security Measures
- [ ] Add IP whitelist middleware
- [ ] Implement 2FA for team members
- [ ] Add audit logs for all actions
- [ ] Set up rate limiting

### 5. Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Configure Vercel deployment for console app
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Configure subdomain (e.g., console.yourdomain.com)
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerts

## Running the Console App

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The console app will be available at `http://localhost:3002`

## Environment Variables Needed

Create a `.env.local` file in `apps/console` with:
```
# Authentication
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3002
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=your-mongodb-url

# Add other necessary environment variables
```

## Admin App Planning

For the admin app (customer-facing organization management), we should create a similar structure at `apps/admin` with:

- Organization-based authentication
- Member management interface
- Billing and subscription management
- Support for multiple account types (Seminary, Homeschool)
- Organization-specific dashboards

The admin app will share some components with the console but have a different authentication system and permission model.
