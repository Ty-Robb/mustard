# Gemini Model Migration Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration from deprecated Gemini 1.5 models to the new Gemini 2.5/2.0 models in the Mustard application.

## Migration Completed

### 1. Model Availability Testing
- Created `test-model-availability.ts` script to verify which models are accessible
- Confirmed availability of all Gemini 2.5 and 2.0 models in project `pipit-776ui`

### 2. Configuration Updates

#### Default Model
- **Previous**: `gemini-1.5-pro` (deprecated)
- **Current**: `gemini-2.5-pro`
- **Location**: `src/lib/services/vertex-ai.service.ts` (line 577)

#### Agent-Specific Models
All agents now have explicit model assignments:

| Agent | Model | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| summary-generator | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Most cost-efficient for short summaries |
| general-assistant | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Balanced cost and capability |
| biblical-scholar | `gemini-2.5-pro` | Enhanced reasoning for complex analysis |
| theology-assistant | `gemini-2.5-pro` | Complex theological reasoning |
| devotional-guide | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | Cost-efficient for simple responses |
| bible-study-leader | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Good balance for interactive content |
| essay-writer | `gemini-2.5-pro` | High quality output for essays |
| creative-writer | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Creative flexibility at reasonable cost |
| visual-content-creator | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Good for descriptive content |
| data-visualization | `gemini-2.5-flash` | Structured output at reasonable cost |

### 3. Documentation Created

#### Gemini Model Guide (`docs/gemini-model-guide.md`)
Comprehensive guide including:
- Complete list of available models with capabilities
- Model selection strategy by use case
- Performance and cost optimization tips
- Migration instructions from deprecated models
- Troubleshooting guide

#### AI Chat Response Improvements (`docs/ai-chat-response-improvements.md`)
Documents the dual-agent summary system and UI improvements

## Testing Results

### Model Availability (as of 2025-01-09)
```
Available Models (5):
  ✅ gemini-2.5-pro
  ✅ gemini-2.5-flash
  ✅ gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  ✅ gemini-2.0-flash
  ✅ gemini-2.0-flash-lite

Unavailable Models (4):
  ❌ gemini-1.5-pro - Model not found
  ❌ gemini-1.5-flash - Model not found
  ❌ gemini-pro - Model not found
  ❌ gemini-pro-vision - Model not found
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Performance**: Gemini 2.5 models offer enhanced reasoning and faster response times
2. **Cost Optimization**: Using tiered models (flash-lite for simple tasks, pro for complex)
3. **Future-Proof**: Deprecated models will eventually be removed
4. **Better Features**: Access to latest improvements in multimodal understanding

## Verification Steps

To verify the migration is working:

1. **Test Model Availability**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/test-model-availability.ts
   ```

2. **Test Chat Summary Integration**:
   ```bash
   npx tsx src/scripts/test-chat-summary-integration.ts
   ```

3. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```
   Then test the chat functionality at http://localhost:9001/chat

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can temporarily revert to older available models by updating the model names in `vertex-ai.service.ts`. However, since the 1.5 models are deprecated and not available, the only option would be to use the 2.0 models as fallbacks.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor performance and cost metrics with the new models
2. Consider implementing model fallback logic for resilience
3. Update any documentation or user guides that reference old model names
4. Set up alerts for any future model deprecations
