# Presentation UI Fixes - Complete

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues with the presentation display system in the chat interface.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Presentations Showing During Streaming
**Problem**: Presentations were being parsed and displayed while the AI was still responding.
**Solution**: 
- Added check to prevent presentation parsing during streaming (`isStreaming` check in `parsedPresentation`)
- Presentations now only parse and display after streaming completes

### 2. No Preview Mode for Presentations
**Problem**: Presentations were displayed inline immediately, unlike essays which show a preview card first.
**Solution**:
- Created `PresentationPreview.tsx` component similar to `EditorPreview`
- Shows presentation title, slide count, and estimated duration
- Displays first 3 slide titles as tags
- Full presentation only shows when preview is clicked
- Added `showPresentationFull` state to manage preview/full view

### 3. "Make Presentation" Button Redundancy
**Problem**: The button remained visible even after a presentation was created.
**Solution**:
- Added `conversationHasPresentation` prop to track if any message contains a presentation
- `ChatContainer` checks all messages using `PresentationParser.isPresentationContent()`
- Button is hidden when `conversationHasPresentation` is true or current message has presentation
- Prevents duplicate presentations in the same conversation

### 4. Slide Formatting Validation
**Status**: The presentation workflow already enforces strict formatting rules:
- Title slide: No bullets, just title and optional subtitle
- Content slides: EXACTLY 3 bullet points per slide
- Each bullet: EXACTLY 6 words maximum
- Keywords only, no sentences
- Formatter agent enforces these rules in the final phase

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **src/components/chat/PresentationPreview.tsx** (new)
   - Preview card component for presentations
   - Shows metadata and slide previews

2. **src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx**
   - Added `showPresentationFull` state
   - Added `conversationHasPresentation` prop
   - Updated presentation display logic to show preview first
   - Hide "Make Presentation" button when appropriate

3. **src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx**
   - Added presentation detection logic
   - Pass `conversationHasPresentation` to all ChatMessage components

### Key Changes

```typescript
// Prevent parsing during streaming
const parsedPresentation = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (isUser || isStreaming) return null;
  // ... parsing logic
}, [isUser, isStreaming, message.content, parsedResponse]);

// Show preview or full view
{showPresentationFull ? (
  <PresentationNode ... />
) : (
  <PresentationPreview
    onClick={() => setShowPresentationFull(true)}
    ...
  />
)}

// Hide button when presentation exists
{!conversationHasPresentation && !parsedPresentation && (
  <Button>Make Presentation</Button>
)}
```
