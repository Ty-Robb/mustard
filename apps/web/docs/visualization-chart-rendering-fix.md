# Visualization Chart Rendering Fix

## Issue
The AI-powered visualization feature was successfully generating data (as shown in logs), but charts were not rendering in the editor. The "Edit Chart" dialog showed the data was present, but the chart area remained blank.

## Root Causes
1. The ChartNode was defaulting to `null` for data and config
2. The chart insertion process wasn't properly handling the data structure
3. Missing error handling for edge cases where data/config might be malformed

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced ChartNode Error Handling
- Added fallback rendering when data/config is null
- Added debug information to help diagnose issues
- Improved null safety in the chart type selector

### 2. Improved EssayEditor Visualization Handling
- Added better logging for chart insertion
- Enhanced config validation and defaults
- Ensured proper data structure before insertion

### 3. Added Debug Information
- Added visual indicators when chart data is missing
- Console logging for troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ AI successfully generates visualization data
- ✅ API returns properly formatted JSON
- ✅ Chart node receives data
- ⚠️ Chart rendering needs further investigation

## Next Steps
1. Check if ChartRenderer is receiving the correct data format
2. Verify recharts library is properly rendering the chart
3. Consider adding error boundaries around chart rendering
4. Test with different chart types and data structures

## Testing
To test the visualization:
1. Select text with data (e.g., "Sales grew from $1M to $5M over 5 years")
2. Use the visualization toolbar to generate a chart
3. Check browser console for any rendering errors
4. Use the Edit Chart dialog to verify data structure
