## Statistics

### Current Progress
- **Total Verses**: 31,102
- **Vectorized Verses**: 3,817 (12.3%)
- **Remaining Verses**: 27,285

### Time Estimates
- **Average time per verse**: ~0.3 seconds (including API delays)
- **Average time per book**: ~30 minutes
- **Estimated total time remaining**: ~32 hours of processing
- **Recommended approach**: Process 5-10 books per day to avoid rate limits

### Storage Estimates
- **Average storage per verse**: ~8KB
- **Total estimated storage**: ~250MB
- **Current storage used**: ~21MB

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Theme Generation (1-2 weeks)
1. Create theme files for remaining Pentateuch books
2. Generate themes for Historical books
3. Generate themes for Wisdom/Poetry books
4. Generate themes for Prophetic books
5. Generate themes for NT books

### Phase 2: Vectorization (2-3 weeks)
1. Complete Old Testament books by section
2. Complete New Testament books by section
3. Implement progress tracking and resume capability
4. Add error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Quality Assurance (1 week)
1. Verify all verses are vectorized
2. Test search functionality across all books
3. Optimize vector indexes
4. Create performance benchmarks

## Technical Considerations

### API Rate Limiting
- Bible API: Unknown limits, using 3s delay between chapters
- Gemini API: 60 requests/minute, using batch processing
- MongoDB: No limits, but batch inserts for efficiency

### Error Handling
- Network timeouts: Implement exponential backoff
- API errors: Log and retry with delay
- Database errors: Transaction rollback and retry
- Missing verses: Log and continue

### Monitoring
- Progress file: JSON with chapter-level tracking
- Error log: Detailed error information
- Statistics dashboard: Real-time progress visualization
- Health checks: API and database connectivity

## Next Steps
1. Complete Exodus vectorization
2. Generate theme files for Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy
3. Create automated theme generation for remaining books
4. Build comprehensive progress tracking system
5. Implement parallel processing for faster vectorization
