# TypeScript Node.js Types Fix

## Issue
After migrating from pnpm to npm, TypeScript was showing errors for missing Node.js type definitions:
- `Cannot find name 'process'`
- `Cannot find name 'Buffer'`
- `Cannot find name 'require'`
- `Cannot find module 'fs'`
- `Cannot find module 'path'`

## Root Cause
The TypeScript compiler was caching old module resolution paths from the pnpm installation, even though `@types/node` was already installed in the package.json.

## Solution
1. **Clean Installation**: Removed all cached files and dependencies
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .next
   ```

2. **Fresh npm Install**: Reinstalled all dependencies with npm
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Verification
Created and ran a test script that verified all Node.js types are working correctly:
- `process` global
- `Buffer` class
- `require` function
- `fs` and `path` modules

## Result
✅ All TypeScript errors related to Node.js types have been resolved
✅ The Genkit integration and all other TypeScript files now compile without errors
✅ The project is ready for development with proper type support

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always clean install when switching package managers
2. Clear TypeScript and build caches when encountering module resolution issues
3. Ensure `@types/node` is included in devDependencies for Node.js projects
