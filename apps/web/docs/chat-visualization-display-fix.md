# Chat Visualization Display Fix

## Issue
Charts were not displaying in the chat interface after AI responses that included visualization data.

## Root Cause
The issue was a timing problem where temporary messages (pending user message and streaming message) were persisting in the UI even after the actual messages with attachments were loaded from the database.

## Investigation Process

1. **Backend Verification**: The backend system was working correctly:
   - AI agents were generating visualization JSON blocks
   - VisualizationParser was extracting attachments properly
   - Messages with attachments were being saved to MongoDB

2. **Frontend Issue**: The problem was in the frontend message display logic:
   - When streaming completed, the `streamingMessage` state wasn't being cleared
   - This caused the ChatContainer to continue showing temporary messages
   - The temporary messages don't have attachments, so charts weren't displayed

## Solution Implemented

Fixed the timing issue in `src/hooks/useChat.ts`:

```typescript
if (data === '[DONE]') {
  console.log('[useChat] Streaming complete, reloading session');
  // Clear pending user message and streaming message when done
  setPendingUserMessage(null);
  setStreamingMessage(''); // Added this line to clear streaming message
  // Reload session to get the saved messages with attachments
  if (sessionId) {
    await loadSession(sessionId);
  }
  return;
}
```

## How It Works Now

1. User sends a message requesting a visualization
2. AI generates response with chart/table JSON blocks
3. During streaming, temporary messages are shown
4. When streaming completes:
   - Temporary messages are cleared
   - Session is reloaded from database
   - Real messages with attachments are displayed
   - Charts and tables render properly

## Verification

The system includes extensive logging:
- Chat API logs when attachments are saved
- useChat hook logs when sessions are loaded
- ChatMessage component logs attachment rendering

## Testing

To test chart visualization:
1. Start a new chat session
2. Ask for data visualization (e.g., "Show me a chart of Methodist membership over time")
3. The AI should generate a response with a chart
4. The chart should display after the response completes
