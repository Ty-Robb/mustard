# Dynamic Favicon Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds dynamic favicon switching based on the application's theme mode, with support for both manual theme selection and system dark mode preferences.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Fixed TypeScript Build Error
- Fixed the `SlideNode.tsx` file where `'twoColumn'` was inconsistent with the `SlideLayout` type definition
- Changed all occurrences to `'two-column'` to match the type definition in `presentation.ts`

### 2. Enhanced Theme Context
- Updated `ThemeContext` to support system theme detection
- Added `'system'` as a theme option alongside 'light', 'dark', and 'sepia'
- Introduced `resolvedTheme` to track the actual theme being used (resolves 'system' to either 'light' or 'dark')
- Added automatic detection of system dark mode preferences

### 3. Created Dynamic Favicon Component
- Created `DynamicFavicon.tsx` component that:
  - Monitors theme changes via the `useTheme` hook
  - Dynamically updates the favicon based on the resolved theme
  - Uses `/favicon.ico` for light themes
  - Uses `/favicondarkmode.ico` for dark theme

### 4. Integration
- Integrated `DynamicFavicon` component into the root layout
- Moved favicon files from `src/app/` to `public/` directory for proper serving

## Files Modified/Created

1. **src/components/editor/extensions/SlideNode.tsx**
   - Fixed TypeScript errors by changing 'twoColumn' to 'two-column'

2. **src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx**
   - Added system theme support
   - Added `resolvedTheme` property
   - Enhanced theme detection logic

3. **src/components/DynamicFavicon.tsx** (new)
   - Created component for dynamic favicon management

4. **src/app/layout.tsx**
   - Added DynamicFavicon component import and integration

5. **Favicon files**
   - Moved `favicon.ico` and `favicondarkmode.ico` from `src/app/` to `public/`

## How It Works

1. When the app loads, the `ThemeContext` checks for a saved theme preference
2. If no preference is saved, it defaults to 'system' which follows OS dark mode settings
3. The `DynamicFavicon` component watches the `resolvedTheme` value
4. When the theme changes (either manually or via system preference), the favicon updates automatically
5. The favicon link element in the document head is dynamically updated with the appropriate icon

## Testing

To test the implementation:

1. **Manual Theme Switching**:
   - Change theme to 'dark' → dark mode favicon should appear
   - Change theme to 'light' → light mode favicon should appear
   - Change theme to 'sepia' → light mode favicon should appear

2. **System Theme Detection**:
   - Set theme to 'system'
   - Toggle your OS dark mode setting
   - The favicon should automatically update

3. **Browser Tab Verification**:
   - The favicon should be visible in the browser tab
   - It should update without page refresh when theme changes

## Future Enhancements

- Consider adding transition animations for smoother favicon switching
- Add support for different favicon formats (SVG, PNG) for better quality
- Consider implementing favicon badges for notifications
