# Presentation Scroll Fix Summary

## Issue
The presentation cards in the slide menu navigation were being cut off on the right side when there were multiple slides.

## Root Cause
The flex container inside the ScrollArea component didn't have proper width constraints, causing it to try to fit within the parent width rather than expanding to accommodate all slides.

## Solution
Modified the `PresentationNode.tsx` component with two key changes:

1. **Added `whitespace-nowrap` to ScrollArea className**
   - Prevents the flex container from wrapping
   - Ensures horizontal layout is maintained

2. **Added `w-max` to the flex container div**
   - Makes the container expand to fit all slides
   - Allows proper horizontal scrolling

## Code Changes

```tsx
// Before
<ScrollArea className="w-full" ref={scrollAreaRef}>
  <div className="flex gap-2 pb-2">

// After
<ScrollArea className="w-full whitespace-nowrap" ref={scrollAreaRef}>
  <div className="flex gap-2 pb-2 w-max">
```

## Technical Details

- **Slide Dimensions**: Each thumbnail is 128px × 80px (w-32 h-20)
- **Gap Between Slides**: 8px (gap-2)
- **Scroll Bar Padding**: 8px bottom padding (pb-2)

## Features Maintained

- ✅ Green border highlight for active slide
- ✅ Smooth auto-scroll to center active slide
- ✅ Hover effects on slide thumbnails
- ✅ Slide number badges in bottom-right corner
- ✅ Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, number keys)
- ✅ Fullscreen presentation mode

## Testing

Created test script `src/scripts/test-presentation-scroll-fix.ts` to verify:
- Slides are properly contained within scroll area
- Horizontal scrolling works correctly
- No slides are cut off on the right side

## Result

The presentation slide navigation now properly displays all slides with horizontal scrolling, ensuring no slides are cut off regardless of the number of slides in the presentation.
