# Unified Presentation Editor Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a unified presentation editor that uses the TipTapEditor with SlideNode extension for both documents and presentations, following DRY principles and maximizing code reuse.

## Changes Made

### 1. Presentation Detection and Parsing
- **Updated `presentation-workflow.ts`**: Added `[PRESENTATION START]` and `[PRESENTATION END]` markers to the formatter agent to ensure presentations are properly detected
- **Enhanced `presentation-parser.ts`**: 
  - Added priority detection for explicit presentation markers
  - Added methods to convert presentations to TipTap-compatible format (`toTipTapFormat` and `toTipTapHTML`)
  - Improved content extraction between presentation markers

### 2. Chat UI Integration
- **Modified `ChatMessage.tsx`**: 
  - Removed direct `PresentationNode` usage
  - Updated `PresentationPreview` to open presentations in the TipTap editor
  - Presentations are converted to TipTap HTML format before opening

### 3. Editor Enhancement
- **Updated `Editor.tsx`**:
  - Added presentation detection based on message metadata
  - Conditionally loads SlideNode and SlideBreak extensions for presentations
  - Updates header to show "Presentation Editor" when editing presentations
  - Handles presentation content without markdown conversion

### 4. Type System Updates
- **Extended `ChatMessage` type**: Added `isPresentation` and `presentationTitle` to metadata

## Architecture Benefits

### Code Reuse
- Single editor component (`TipTapEditor`) for all content types
- Shared toolbar, themes, and export functionality
- Unified keyboard shortcuts and interactions

### Maintainability
- One component to update when adding features
- Single source of truth for editor behavior
- Consistent bug fixes across all content types

### Extensibility
- Easy to add new content types by creating new TipTap extensions
- Slide navigation can be added to the toolbar when in presentation mode
- Export functionality can be extended to support presentation formats

## Usage

When a presentation is detected in the chat:
1. User sees a `PresentationPreview` card
2. Clicking the preview opens the presentation in the TipTap editor
3. The editor loads with SlideNode extension enabled
4. Users can edit slides with full formatting capabilities

## Next Steps

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Parallelize presentation agent execution
- [ ] Optimize model selection for faster response times
- [ ] Implement caching for common presentation structures

### Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add slide navigation controls to TipTap toolbar
- [ ] Implement presenter mode with speaker notes
- [ ] Add export to PowerPoint/PDF functionality
- [ ] Create slide templates and themes

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Add slide thumbnails sidebar
- [ ] Implement slide transitions
- [ ] Add real-time collaboration features

## Technical Details

### Presentation Format
Presentations are stored in TipTap HTML format with custom data attributes:
```html
<div data-slide data-layout="title" data-slide-number="1">
  <h1>Slide Title</h1>
  <h2>Subtitle</h2>
</div>
<hr data-slide-break />
```

### Extension Loading
The SlideNode extension is conditionally loaded:
```typescript
extensions={isPresentation ? [SlideNode, SlideBreak] : []}
```

This ensures the editor remains lightweight for regular documents while providing full presentation capabilities when needed.
