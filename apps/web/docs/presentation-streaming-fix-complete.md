# Presentation Streaming Fix - Complete

## Overview
Fixed the issue where presentations were being displayed while the AI was still generating content. The presentation editor should now only appear after the AI has completely finished generating the response.

## Problem
- Presentations were appearing during streaming
- The presentation parser was detecting partial content as valid presentations
- Orchestrator messages during streaming were being misidentified as presentation content

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Strengthened Streaming Checks
**File**: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`
- Added explicit `isStreaming` check in presentation parsing logic
- Added additional check in presentation display condition: `parsedPresentation && !isStreaming`
- Enhanced debug logging to track streaming state

### 2. Content Stability Check
**File**: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`
- Added content stability tracking with 500ms delay
- Presentations are only parsed after content has been stable for 500ms
- Prevents parsing of partial or incomplete content

### 3. Excluded Streaming Artifacts
**File**: `src/lib/utils/presentation-parser.ts`
- Added exclusion patterns for orchestrator/system messages
- Filters out common streaming status messages like "gathering information", "analyzing", etc.
- Prevents false positive presentation detection

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the presentation parsing pipeline
- Tracks streaming state, content stability, and parsing decisions
- Helps diagnose any future issues

## Key Changes

### ChatMessage.tsx
```typescript
// Content stability tracking
const [contentStableAt, setContentStableAt] = React.useState<number | null>(null);
const [isContentStable, setIsContentStable] = React.useState(false);

// Parse only when stable and not streaming
const parsedPresentation = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (isUser || isStreaming) return null;
  if (!isContentStable) return null;
  // ... parsing logic
}, [isUser, isStreaming, message.content, parsedResponse, isContentStable]);

// Display condition includes streaming check
{parsedPresentation && !isStreaming ? (
  // Show presentation
) : (
  // Show other content
)}
```

### PresentationParser.ts
```typescript
// Exclude orchestrator messages
const excludePatterns = [
  /orchestrat/i,
  /gathering information/i,
  /analyzing your question/i,
  // ... more patterns
];

for (const pattern of excludePatterns) {
  if (pattern.test(content)) {
    return false; // Not a presentation
  }
}
```

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Presentations don't appear during streaming
- [x] Presentations only show after AI completes response
- [x] Orchestrator messages are not detected as presentations
- [x] Content stability delay prevents premature parsing
- [x] Debug logging provides clear insights

## Future Considerations
1. The 500ms stability delay could be adjusted if needed
2. Additional exclusion patterns can be added if new streaming messages appear
3. Consider adding a visual indicator when presentation parsing is in progress
