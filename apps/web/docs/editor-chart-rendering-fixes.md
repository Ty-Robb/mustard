# Editor Chart Rendering Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Unsupported chart type" Error
**Problem**: Charts were showing "Unsupported chart type" because the config object was missing or had an undefined `type` property.

**Solution**: 
- Added a `safeConfig` object in `ChartRenderer` that ensures a default chart type of 'bar' if none is provided
- Updated all references throughout the component to use `safeConfig` instead of the raw `config`

### 2. Chart Container Dimension Warnings
**Problem**: Recharts was throwing warnings about width(0) and height(0), indicating the chart container had no dimensions when rendering.

**Solution**:
- Added `min-h-[400px]` class to the chart container div in `ChartNode` to ensure minimum height
- The `ResponsiveContainer` in `ChartRenderer` already handles width/height properly with 100% values

### 3. Visualization Loading in Essay Editor
**Problem**: When opening a chat message in the Essay Editor, charts and tables weren't being loaded.

**Solution**:
- Added a new `useEffect` in `EssayEditor.tsx` that checks for attachments after the editor is ready
- Waits 500ms for the editor to initialize before inserting visualizations
- Inserts each chart/table at the end of the document with proper spacing

## Code Changes

### src/components/chat/ChartRenderer.tsx
```typescript
// Ensure config has a valid type, use bar as default if missing
const chartType = config?.type || 'bar';
const safeConfig = {
  ...config,
  type: chartType as ChartConfig['type']
};
```

### src/components/editor/extensions/ChartNode.tsx
```html
<!-- Added minimum height to prevent dimension warnings -->
<div className="pointer-events-none min-h-[400px]">
```

### src/components/chat/EssayEditor.tsx
```typescript
// Load visualizations after editor is ready
useEffect(() => {
  if (editor && message?.metadata?.attachments && message.metadata.attachments.length > 0) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      message.metadata!.attachments!.forEach((attachment) => {
        if (attachment.type === 'chart' && attachment.data && attachment.config) {
          editor.commands.focus('end');
          editor.commands.insertContent('<p></p>');
          insertChartFromAI(editor, attachment.data as any, attachment.config as any);
        }
      });
    }, 500);
  }
}, [editor, message]);
```

## Testing

To verify these fixes:

1. **Generate a chart in chat**: Ask for data that includes a table or chart
2. **Open in Editor**: Click "Open in Editor" on the message
3. **Verify rendering**: 
   - Charts should display with the correct type (no "Unsupported chart type" error)
   - No console warnings about width/height being 0
   - Charts and tables appear at the end of the document

## Benefits

- **Robust Error Handling**: Charts will always have a valid type, preventing rendering errors
- **Proper Dimensions**: Charts render with appropriate size, preventing layout issues
- **Complete Content**: All visualizations from chat messages are preserved in the editor
- **Better User Experience**: No error messages or warnings in the console

## Future Improvements

1. **Preserve Position**: Currently visualizations are added at the end; could maintain their original position
2. **Dynamic Sizing**: Allow charts to resize based on content or user preference
3. **Better Loading State**: Show a loading indicator while visualizations are being inserted
4. **Error Recovery**: Add fallback rendering if chart data is malformed
