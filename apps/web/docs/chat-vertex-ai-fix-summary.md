# Chat System Vertex AI Integration Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed the chat system to exclusively use Vertex AI/Gemini models instead of OpenAI/Anthropic, making it suitable for a Bible study application with ministry-focused agents.

## Changes Made

### 1. Chat Service Updates (`src/lib/services/chat.service.ts`)
- **Removed** all default agents that used OpenAI/Anthropic
- **Removed** dependencies on `@ai-sdk/openai`, `@ai-sdk/anthropic`, and `@ai-sdk/google`
- **Updated** `getAllAgents()` to only return Vertex AI agents
- **Simplified** `generateCompletion()` to only use Vertex AI
- **Fixed** title generation to use Vertex AI instead of OpenAI

- **Added** new ministry-focused agents:
  - General Assistant - For general ministry and church tasks

# For local development
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account-key.json

# For production (base64 encoded service account JSON)
GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=base64-encoded-json
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything is working:

```bash
npm run test:chat-vertex
```

Or directly:

```bash

```
