# LMS MongoDB Build Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The build was failing with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'child_process'
```

This occurred because:
1. The `/lms-test` page was importing `CourseSelector` component
2. `CourseSelector` imported `lms.service.ts` 
3. `lms.service.ts` imported MongoDB
4. MongoDB requires Node.js modules like `child_process` which aren't available in the browser

## Solution
We already had a client-safe version called `CourseSelectorClient` that uses API calls instead of direct MongoDB imports. The fix was to update the import in the lms-test page:

```typescript
// Before (causes build error)
import { CourseSelector } from '@/components/lms/CourseSelector';

// After (client-safe)
import { CourseSelectorClient } from '@/components/lms/CourseSelectorClient';
```

## Verification
All LMS components are now client-safe:
- ✅ **CourseSelectorClient** - Uses fetch API instead of MongoDB
- ✅ **QuizComponent** - Only imports UI components and types
- ✅ **StepNavigator** - Only imports UI components and types
- ✅ **LMSModeContainer** - Uses client-safe hooks and components

## Key Takeaway
When building Next.js applications, always ensure that client components don't import server-side dependencies like MongoDB. Use API routes to handle database operations and fetch data from client components.

## Architecture Pattern
```
Client Component → API Route → MongoDB Service
```

This pattern ensures:
1. Clean separation of concerns
2. No server-side imports in client code
3. Proper security (database credentials stay on server)
4. Better performance (smaller client bundles)
