# Presentation Builder Cleanup

## Date: January 5, 2025

## Summary
Removed the presentation builder components and related files to fix build errors and simplify the codebase. The application now uses only the PresentationNode component from the chat stream for displaying presentations.

## Files Removed

### Components
1. `src/components/presentation/PresentationBuilder.tsx` - Original presentation builder with type errors
2. `src/components/presentation/PresentationBuilderV2.tsx` - Second version that also had type issues

### Pages
3. `src/app/(protected)/test-presentation-builder/` - Test page for the removed builders

### Services
4. `src/lib/services/presentation-agent.service.ts` - Service only used by PresentationBuilderV2

### Test Scripts
5. `src/scripts/test-presentation-improvements.ts` - Test script for the removed service

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/app/(protected)/chat/page.tsx`
- Removed import of PresentationBuilderV2
- Removed all state and logic related to activePresentationMessage
- Simplified the editor detection to only handle essay/document content
- Removed presentation builder from the right panel rendering

### 2. `src/app/(protected)/test-presentation-builder/page.tsx`
- Updated to use PresentationBuilderV2 instead of PresentationBuilder (before deletion)

## Build Errors Fixed

The main issue was that both PresentationBuilder components were trying to import `PresentationTheme` from `@/types/presentation`, but this type doesn't exist in the types file.

## Current State

- Build passes successfully with no errors
- Only PresentationNode is used for displaying presentations in the chat
- Clean foundation for building a new presentation editor on a separate branch

## Next Steps

1. Create a new branch for the presentation editor rebuild
2. Base the new editor on PresentationNode to ensure consistency
3. Use the same PresentationParser for both viewing and editing
4. Add editing capabilities while maintaining the same display logic
