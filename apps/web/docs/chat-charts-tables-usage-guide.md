# How to Use Charts and Tables in Chat

## Quick Start

1. **Select the Right Agent**: In the chat interface, select the "Data Visualization Specialist" agent from the dropdown menu. Look for the chart icon (ðŸ“Š).

2. **Ask for Visualizations**: 
   - For charts: "Show me a chart of church growth over the last 5 years"
   - For tables: "Create a table of our staff members by department"
   - For both: "Compare this year's budget to last year with charts and tables"

## Important Notes

- **You MUST select the "Data Visualization Specialist" agent** - other agents (like Essay Writer) will not generate charts/tables
- The agent will appear in the Vertex AI section of the agent dropdown
- Look for capabilities tags: "charts", "tables", "data-analysis", "visualization"

## Example Prompts

### Charts
- "Show me a line chart of attendance trends"
- "Create a pie chart of budget allocation"
- "Display a bar graph comparing ministry areas"
- "Generate a scatter plot of giving patterns"

### Tables
- "Create a sortable table of volunteer schedules"
- "Show me a staff directory table with filtering"
- "Display budget items in a paginated table"
- "List all small groups in a searchable table"

### Research & Analysis
- "Analyze church growth trends and show me visualizations"
- "Compare youth vs adult attendance with charts"
- "Show demographic breakdown in both chart and table format"

## Features

### Chart Features
- Interactive hover tooltips
- Multiple chart types (line, bar, pie, area, radar, scatter)
- Responsive design
- Custom colors and legends

### Table Features
- Click headers to sort
- Search/filter functionality
- Pagination for large datasets
- Export capabilities (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

### "I asked for a chart but got an essay"
- Make sure you've selected the "Data Visualization Specialist" agent
- The agent dropdown should show a chart icon (ðŸ“Š) next to the selected agent

### Charts/Tables not appearing
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page

### Data looks incorrect
- Be specific about what data you want visualized
- Provide context or sample data if needed
- Ask follow-up questions to refine the visualization

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "show me data", say "show me a line chart of Sunday attendance for 2024"

2. **Provide Context**: "We have 5 ministries with these budgets..." helps the AI generate accurate data

3. **Iterate**: After seeing a chart, you can ask "add a trend line" or "change to a bar chart"

4. **Combine with Analysis**: The AI will provide insights along with visualizations

5. **Use Follow-ups**: "Why did attendance drop in March?" will get contextual analysis

## Advanced Usage

You can request complex visualizations:
- "Show me a stacked bar chart comparing all ministries across quarters"
- "Create a dashboard with attendance, giving, and volunteer charts"
- "Generate a correlation matrix table for our metrics"

The AI understands context, so you can have a natural conversation about the data while viewing the visualizations.
