# Orchestrator Presentation Formatting Fix

## Issue
Presentations were not displaying with proper formatting when generated through the multi-agent orchestration system. The formatter agent was executing correctly but its output wasn't being used.

## Root Cause
The orchestrator's `synthesizePresentationResults` method was looking for non-existent agents ('slide-designer', 'body-writer') instead of the actual presentation workflow agents, particularly the 'formatter-agent' which contains the final formatted presentation.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Orchestrator Synthesis (orchestrator.service.ts)
Updated the `synthesizePresentationResults` method to:
- Look for the 'formatter-agent' output first (contains the final formatted presentation)
- Return the presentation as a `content` string instead of a slides array
- Add fallback logic to find presentation content from other agents
- Include metadata about the workflow used

### 2. Fixed Chat Service Formatting (chat.service.ts)
Updated the `generateOrchestrationCompletion` method to:
- Check for `deliverable.content` first (new format)
- Fall back to `deliverable.slides` for backward compatibility
- Properly handle the formatted presentation string from the orchestrator

## Result
Presentations now display with proper formatting:
- Correct slide structure with markdown headers
- Bullet points limited to 3-5 per slide
- Each bullet contains 6-10 words
- Support for two-column layouts and images
- Clean output without raw tags like [SUMMARY] or [CONTENT]

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Ask for a presentation: "Create a presentation about forgiveness"
2. The system will use the multi-agent orchestration
3. The formatter agent will produce the final formatted output
4. The presentation will display with proper formatting
