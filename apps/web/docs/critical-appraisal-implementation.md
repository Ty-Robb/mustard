# Critical Appraisal Implementation

## Overview

We've successfully implemented critical appraisal capability across the multi-agent orchestration system. This enhancement enables agents to provide balanced, analytical evaluations of subjects rather than just presenting information.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Agents

The following agents now have critical appraisal capabilities:

#### Research & Analysis Agents
- **General Research Agent** (`research-agent`)
  - Conducts web research with critical evaluation
  - Identifies biases and limitations in sources
  - Provides balanced perspectives

- **Biblical Research Specialist** (`biblical-research`)
  - Analyzes scripture with hermeneutical awareness
  - Provides critical examination of interpretive traditions
  - Evaluates denominational perspectives

- **Data Analysis Agent** (`data-analyst`)
  - Performs statistical analysis with methodology critique
  - Assesses limitations and assumptions
  - Provides confidence intervals and significance testing

- **Source Validation Agent** (`source-validator`)
  - Critically evaluates claims and source reliability
  - Identifies conflicting evidence and perspectives
  - Provides confidence levels for facts

#### Content Creation Agents
- **Body Content Writer** (`body-writer`)
  - Develops content with critical analysis
  - Integrates and evaluates supporting evidence
  - Presents multiple viewpoints fairly

- **Conclusion Specialist** (`conclusion-writer`)
  - Creates thoughtful conclusions with nuanced perspectives
  - Acknowledges limitations and open questions
  - Provides balanced assessments

#### Domain Specialists
- **Theological Analysis Expert** (`theology-analyst`)
  - Provides theological analysis with scholarly critique
  - Examines theological assumptions critically
  - Facilitates ecumenical dialogue

### 2. New Critical Appraisal Specialist

Added a dedicated **Critical Appraisal Specialist** (`critical-appraiser`):
- Model: Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Temperature: 0.4 (balanced analytical output)
- Responsibilities:
  - Comprehensive critical analysis
  - Identifying strengths and weaknesses
  - Evaluating evidence quality
  - Presenting balanced perspectives
  - Highlighting assumptions and biases
  - Suggesting areas for improvement

### 3. Orchestrator Integration

The orchestrator now:
- Detects when critical appraisal is needed based on task analysis
- Automatically includes critical appraisal agents in workflows
- Provides specialized prompts for critical evaluation

### 4. Workflow Templates

Updated workflow templates to include critical appraisal:
- **Presentations**: Critical appraiser in research phase
- **Essays**: Critical analysis alongside research
- **Articles**: Balanced evaluation throughout

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Essay Request
```typescript
{
  task: "Tell me about artificial intelligence and its impact on society",
  deliverableType: "essay"
}
```
The system will:
1. Include the critical appraiser in the research phase
2. Ensure balanced perspectives in content
3. Acknowledge limitations and concerns

### Example 2: Theological Analysis
```typescript
{
  task: "Analyze the doctrine of justification by faith",
  deliverableType: "article",
  context: { denomination: "Protestant" }
}
```
The system will:
1. Use theological analyst with critical appraisal
2. Present multiple denominational perspectives
3. Examine theological assumptions

## Testing

Run the test script to verify implementation:
```bash
npm run test:script test-critical-appraisal
```

## Benefits

1. **Balanced Analysis**: Users receive well-rounded evaluations
2. **Transparency**: Assumptions and biases are clearly identified
3. **Quality**: Higher quality outputs with nuanced perspectives
4. **Trust**: Users can make informed decisions based on critical analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. Add user preference for critical appraisal level (light/moderate/deep)
2. Create specialized critical appraisal templates for different domains
3. Implement citation and evidence scoring
4. Add comparative analysis capabilities
