# Presentation Cleanup Complete

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up all presentation components that were not part of the chat stream, ensuring presentations only appear in the chat interface as requested.

## Files Deleted
1. **src/components/presentation/TipTapSlideRenderer.tsx** - Unused presentation renderer
2. **src/components/presentation/** - Empty folder removed
3. **src/components/presentation/PresentationBuilder.tsx** - Already deleted in previous session
4. **src/components/presentation/PresentationBuilderV2.tsx** - Already deleted in previous session
5. **src/lib/services/presentation-agent.service.ts** - Already deleted in previous session
6. **src/app/(protected)/test-presentation-builder/** - Already deleted in previous session
7. **src/scripts/test-presentation-improvements.ts** - Already deleted in previous session

## Remaining Presentation Components (In Chat Stream)
These components remain as they are part of the chat stream functionality:
- **PresentationNode** - Main component for displaying presentations in chat
- **PresentationPreview** - Preview card that expands to full presentation
- **PresentationParser** - Utility for parsing AI responses into presentation format

## How Presentations Work Now
1. **Via "Make Presentation" Button**: 
   - User gets an essay response
   - Clicks "Make me a presentation" button
   - Sends specific prompt that triggers orchestration
   - Multi-agent workflow creates properly formatted presentation
   - Displays in chat stream using PresentationNode

2. **Via Direct Chat Request**:
   - User types request mentioning "presentation", "slides", etc.
   - If detected, uses orchestration workflow
   - If not detected (e.g., simple questions), may not format as presentation
   - See `docs/presentation-generation-issue-analysis.md` for details

## Build Status
- All presentation-related build errors resolved
- No references to deleted components remain
- Application builds successfully

## Next Steps
If you want to improve presentation generation consistency:
1. Enhance detection logic in `shouldUseOrchestration()`
2. Add explicit "Presentation Mode" UI toggle
3. Ensure all presentation requests use the same workflow
4. Consider adding "Convert to Presentation" button for any response
