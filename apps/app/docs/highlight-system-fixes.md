# Highlight System Fixes - August 25, 2025

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with the Bible reader highlight system after a system crash.

## Current Status
- ✅ AI highlights are being created with proper color (#dbeafe)
- ✅ Highlights are loading (though only 1 of 4 shows due to reference format issues)
- ⚠️ Manual highlights need testing with improved verse ID extraction
- ✅ DOM manipulation errors have been resolved

## Issues Identified

1. **Highlights not persisting to database**
   - Manual highlights were not being saved
   - AI highlights had no color when displayed

2. **Text selection issues**
   - `window.getSelection()` doesn't work with TipTap editor
   - Selected text was not being captured properly

3. **DOM manipulation errors**
   - "Node cannot be found in the current page" errors when applying highlights
   - Direct DOM manipulation conflicted with TipTap's virtual DOM

4. **Reference format mismatches**
   - Highlights stored with different reference formats (e.g., "1JN.1" vs "1 John 1")
   - Highlights not loading due to format inconsistencies

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Text Capture in BibleReader Component

**File**: `src/components/bible/BibleReader.tsx`

- Updated `handleHighlight` function to capture text using TipTap's API:
  ```typescript
  const selectedText = editor.state.doc.textBetween(from, to);
  ```
- Modified `onHighlight` callback to include `selectedText` parameter
- Ensured all highlight creation includes the actual selected text

### 2. Fixed Highlight Persistence

**File**: `src/app/(protected)/bible-reader/page.tsx`

- Updated `handleHighlight` to properly save highlights with all required fields:
  ```typescript
  const handleHighlight = useCallback(async (verseId: string, color: string, selectedText: string) => {
    // Validates user authentication
    // Validates selected text exists
    // Sends proper API request with all highlight data
  })
  ```

### 3. Fixed DOM Manipulation Issues

**File**: `src/components/bible/BibleReader.tsx`

- Replaced direct DOM manipulation with TipTap's transaction-based approach:
  ```typescript
  // Use TipTap's find and replace functionality
  doc.descendants((node, pos) => {
    // Search for text within TipTap's document model
    // Apply highlights using tr.addMark()
  });
  ```
- This prevents DOM sync issues and "Node cannot be found" errors

### 4. Improved Reference Format Matching

**File**: `src/app/(protected)/bible-reader/page.tsx`

- Implemented flexible reference matching when loading highlights:
  - Tries multiple reference formats (e.g., "1JN.1", "1 John 1")
  - Filters highlights client-side for partial matches
  - Handles various book name formats

### 5. Added Color to AI Highlights

**File**: `src/components/bible/AIInsightsPanel.tsx`

- AI highlights now include a default light blue color (#dbeafe)
- Ensures visual consistency between manual and AI highlights

## Database Consistency

- The highlight service correctly uses Firebase UID for database naming
- No changes needed to the database structure
- Highlights are stored in user-specific databases

## Testing

Created test script: `src/scripts/test-highlights.ts`
- Tests highlight creation, retrieval, and deletion
- Validates reference format handling
- Checks highlight statistics

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Performance**: The current implementation searches through all text nodes for each highlight. For chapters with many highlights, consider optimizing this approach.

2. **Reference Normalization**: Consider implementing a reference normalization system to standardize how references are stored and queried.

3. **Highlight Conflicts**: When multiple highlights overlap, the current system may have visual conflicts. Consider implementing highlight layering or merging logic.

## Usage

To test the highlight system:
1. Select text in the Bible reader
2. Choose a highlight color from the toolbar
3. The highlight should persist and reload when returning to the chapter
4. AI insights should also create highlights with proper colors

## Technical Details

- **TipTap Version**: Using @tiptap/react with multicolor highlight support
- **Database**: MongoDB with user-specific collections
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth tokens for API requests
- **Reference Format**: Supports both API format (e.g., "1JN.1.1") and display format (e.g., "1 John 1:1")

## Latest Updates (August 25, 2025 - 5:30 PM)

### Manual Highlight Fix
Added improved verse ID extraction with fallback:
- Better DOM traversal using TipTap's resolved positions
- Fallback to chapter-level reference if verse ID not found
- Comprehensive debugging logs to track the flow

### AI Highlights Color
Confirmed AI highlights are created with light blue color (#dbeafe) in `AIInsightsPanel.tsx`

### Debugging Added
- Console logs in `handleHighlight` (BibleReader.tsx)
- Console logs in `handleHighlight` (bible-reader/page.tsx)
- Tracks the complete flow from selection to database save

## Next Steps

1. **Test Manual Highlights**: Select text and choose a color to verify the fix works
2. **Reference Format Investigation**: Check why only 1 of 4 AI highlights loads
3. **Consider Reference Normalization**: Implement a consistent reference format system
