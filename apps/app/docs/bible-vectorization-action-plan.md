# Bible Vectorization Action Plan

## Executive Summary
This action plan outlines the steps to complete vectorization of all 66 books of the Bible (~31,000 verses) over the next 3-4 weeks. The project will enable powerful semantic search capabilities across the entire Bible.

## Current Status (as of today)
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure: Complete
- ‚úÖ Scripts: Ready
- üìä Progress: 3 books with themes, 2.5 books vectorized (~3,800 verses / 12%)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Time to completion: 3-4 weeks

## Week 1: Foundation & Pentateuch
**Goal**: Complete all 5 Pentateuch books (5,852 verses)

### Day 1-2: Complete Current Work
- [x] Finish Exodus vectorization (in progress)
- [ ] Generate themes for Leviticus (27 chapters)
- [ ] Generate themes for Numbers (36 chapters)
- [ ] Generate themes for Deuteronomy (34 chapters)

### Day 3-4: Vectorize Remaining Pentateuch
- [ ] Vectorize Leviticus (859 verses)
- [ ] Vectorize Numbers (1,288 verses)
- [ ] Vectorize Deuteronomy (959 verses)

### Day 5: Quality Check & Optimization
- [ ] Test search across all Pentateuch books
- [ ] Optimize batch sizes based on performance
- [ ] Document any issues or improvements

## Week 2: Historical & Wisdom Books
**Goal**: Complete 17 books (Historical + Wisdom = 7,903 verses)

### Day 1-2: Generate Themes
- [ ] Historical books themes (12 books)
- [ ] Wisdom/Poetry themes (5 books)

### Day 3-5: Vectorize Books
- [ ] Small books first (Ruth, Esther, etc.)
- [ ] Medium books (Samuel, Kings, Chronicles)
- [ ] Large books (Job, Psalms, Proverbs)

## Week 3: Prophets & Gospels
**Goal**: Complete 21 books (Prophets + Gospels = 8,547 verses)

### Day 1-2: Generate Themes
- [ ] Major Prophets themes (5 books)
- [ ] Minor Prophets themes (12 books)
- [ ] Gospels themes (3 remaining)

### Day 3-5: Vectorize Books
- [ ] Minor Prophets (small books)
- [ ] Major Prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel)
- [ ] Gospels (Mark, Luke, John)

## Week 4: New Testament & Finalization
**Goal**: Complete remaining 22 books (8,800 verses) and finalize project

### Day 1-2: Generate Themes
- [ ] Acts theme
- [ ] Pauline Epistles themes (13 books)
- [ ] General Epistles themes (8 books)
- [ ] Revelation theme

### Day 3-4: Vectorize Books
- [ ] Acts (1,007 verses)
- [ ] All Epistles (small books)
- [ ] Revelation (404 verses)

### Day 5: Final Quality Assurance
- [ ] Verify all 31,102 verses vectorized
- [ ] Run comprehensive search tests
- [ ] Generate final statistics report
- [ ] Update all documentation

## Daily Workflow

### Morning (2-3 hours)
1. Generate themes for 5-10 books using AI script
2. Review and adjust generated themes
3. Commit theme files to repository

### Afternoon (3-4 hours)
1. Run vectorization for 2-3 books
2. Monitor progress and handle any errors
3. Update progress documentation

### Evening (1 hour)
1. Run statistics check
2. Test search functionality
3. Plan next day's books

## Automation Scripts to Run

### Theme Generation
```bash
# Generate themes for a single book
npm run generate-themes single <BOOK_CODE>

# Example for multiple books
for book in LEV NUM DEU; do
  npm run generate-themes single $book
  sleep 60  # Pause between books
done
```

### Vectorization
```bash
# Vectorize a single book
npm run vectorize-book <BOOK_CODE>

# Monitor progress in another terminal
npm run monitor-progress <BOOK_CODE>
```

### Progress Checking
```bash
# Check overall statistics
npm run check-vector-stats

# Test search functionality
npm run test:vector-search
```

## Risk Mitigation

### API Rate Limits
- **Risk**: Hitting Gemini API limits
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Process max 10 books per day
  - Implement exponential backoff
  - Use batch processing

### Network Failures
- **Risk**: Connection timeouts
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement retry logic
  - Save progress after each chapter
  - Resume capability

### Data Quality
- **Risk**: Poor theme generation
- **Mitigation**:
  - Manual review of AI-generated themes
  - Test searches for each completed book
  - Iterate on problematic themes

## Success Criteria
1. ‚úÖ All 66 books have theme files
2. ‚úÖ All 31,102 verses successfully vectorized
3. ‚úÖ Search returns relevant results for test queries
4. ‚úÖ No data corruption or missing verses
5. ‚úÖ Performance meets targets (<100ms search time)
