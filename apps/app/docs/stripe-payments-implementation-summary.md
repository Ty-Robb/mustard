# Stripe Payments Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully set up a comprehensive Stripe payment system for the Mustard application, including a modular payments package following Turborepo best practices.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **@repo/payments Package**
Created a new shared payments package with:
- **Structure**: Following Turborepo conventions with proper exports
- **Server-side logic**: Stripe client, checkout, webhooks, pricing analysis
- **Client components**: Checkout button component
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript support with shared types
- **Environment handling**: Using @t3-oss/env-nextjs for type-safe env vars

### 2. **API Endpoints**
Updated and created the following endpoints:
- `/api/payments/checkout` - Create and retrieve checkout sessions
- `/api/payments/webhook` - Handle Stripe webhook events
- `/api/payments/history` - Get user's payment history

### 3. **UI Components**
- **Purchase Success Page** (`/courses/purchase-success`)
  - Shows payment confirmation
  - Displays purchase details
  - Provides next steps for users
  
- **Payment History Page** (`/account/payment-history`)
  - Lists all past transactions
  - Shows payment status with badges
  - Allows invoice downloads

### 4. **Features Implemented**
- ✅ Stripe checkout integration
- ✅ Webhook handling for payment events
- ✅ Course access granting after payment
- ✅ Payment history tracking
- ✅ Van Westendorp pricing analysis support
- ✅ Subscription support (webhook handlers ready)
- ✅ Refund handling
- ✅ Dynamic pricing capabilities

### 5. **Documentation**
Created comprehensive setup guide covering:
- Stripe account setup
- Environment configuration
- Webhook setup
- Product/price creation
- Testing procedures
- Production deployment

## Architecture Benefits

### Modular Design
- Payment logic separated into `@repo/payments` package
- Can be reused across multiple apps
- Clear separation of concerns

### Type Safety
- Shared types in `@repo/types`
- Type-safe environment variables
- Full TypeScript coverage

### Scalability
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Subscription-ready architecture
- Dynamic pricing capabilities

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. **Immediate Setup Required**
```bash
# Add to .env.local
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:9001
```

### 2. **Database Setup**
Create course pricing documents in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.course_prices.insertOne({
  courseId: "your-course-id",
  basePrice: 49.99,
  currency: "usd",
  dynamicPricing: {
    enabled: false,
    algorithm: "van_westendorp",
    adjustmentPercentage: 0
  }
});
```

### 3. **Testing**
1. Create a test course
2. Add pricing to the course
3. Test the checkout flow
4. Verify webhook processing

### 4. **Production Deployment**
1. Set up production Stripe account
2. Configure production webhook endpoint
3. Update environment variables
4. Test with real payments

```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Why a separate package?**
   - Reusability across apps
   - Clean separation of payment logic
   - Easier testing and maintenance

2. **Why Van Westendorp pricing?**
   - Data-driven pricing optimization
   - Built-in survey system
   - Dynamic pricing capabilities

3. **Why webhook-based processing?**
   - Reliable payment confirmation
   - Handles edge cases (browser closes, etc.)
   - Supports async payment methods

## Security Considerations

- ✅ Webhook signature verification
- ✅ Server-side payment validation
- ✅ Environment variable protection
- ✅ Authentication on all endpoints
- ✅ No sensitive data in client code

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. Set up Stripe webhook monitoring
2. Add error tracking (Sentry)
3. Monitor payment success rates
4. Track pricing optimization metrics
5. Set up alerts for failed payments

This implementation provides a solid foundation for processing payments with room for growth and optimization.
