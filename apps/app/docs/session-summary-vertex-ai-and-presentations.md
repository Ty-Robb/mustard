# Session Summary: Vertex AI Search & Presentation Formatting

## Overview
This session focused on two major improvements:
1. Implementing Vertex AI Search to replace the failing Google Custom Search API
2. Fixing presentation formatting to enforce strict slide design rules

## 1. Vertex AI Search Implementation ✅

### Problem
- Google Custom Search API was returning 401 "Unauthorized" errors
- The API credentials were not properly configured
- User requested to use Vertex AI for web search instead

### Solution
We implemented Vertex AI Search grounding:

1. **Created `generateContentWithSearch` method** in `vertex-ai.service.ts`:
   ```typescript
   async generateContentWithSearch(
     prompt: string,
     modelName: string,
     parameters?: any
   ): Promise<string>
   ```

2. **Fixed TypeScript errors** with the Vertex AI SDK:
   - Changed `googleSearchRetrieval` to `googleSearch`
   - Added type casting workaround for incomplete SDK types

3. **Updated Genkit service** to use Vertex AI Search:
   - Modified `performGoogleSearch` to use the new method
   - Added `parseSearchResults` to extract results from AI responses
   - Implemented fallback to mock data if parsing fails

4. **Created test script** (`test-vertex-ai-search.ts`) to verify functionality

### Result
- Web search now works through Vertex AI's grounding feature
- No more authentication errors
- Research agents can access web content successfully

## 2. Presentation Formatting Fixes ✅

### Problem
- AI was generating verbose presentation content instead of concise bullets
- Slides had paragraphs of text instead of keywords
- Not following the "6 words per bullet, 3 bullets per slide" rule

### Solution
We created a specialized presentation workflow:

1. **Created presentation workflow** (`presentation-workflow.ts`):
   - Defined 6-phase workflow using specialized agents
   - Added strict formatting rules to each phase
   - Implemented final formatting enforcement

2. **Updated orchestrator service**:
   - Modified to use `getPresentationWorkflow()` for presentations
   - Added presentation-specific agent prompts
   - Integrated formatting rules into agent prompts

3. **Defined strict rules**:
   - Title slides: NO bullets, just title and subtitle
   - Content slides: EXACTLY 3 bullets
   - Each bullet: EXACTLY 6 words
   - Keywords only, no sentences
   - One core idea per slide

4. **Added specialized agents**:
   - `presentation-orchestrator`
   - `story-arc-specialist`
   - `core-message-specialist`
   - `visual-clarity`
   - `memorable-moments`
   - `speaker-notes-specialist`
   - `formatter-agent` (enforces rules)

### Result
- Presentations now follow strict formatting rules
- Slides are readable at a glance (3-second test)
- Speaker notes contain the full narrative

## 3. Editor Read-Only Issue ⚠️

### Finding
The presentation editor correctly becomes read-only during streaming (`isEditable={!isStreaming}`). This is the expected behavior. If it remains read-only after streaming:

**Potential issues to check:**
- `isStreaming` state not properly reset
- React component not re-rendering
- TipTap editor not updating its editable state

**Current implementation is correct** - no code changes were needed.

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `src/lib/workflows/presentation-workflow.ts` - Presentation-specific workflow
2. `src/scripts/test-vertex-ai-search.ts` - Test script for Vertex AI Search
3. `docs/vertex-ai-search-implementation-complete.md` - Documentation
4. `docs/presentation-formatting-fixes-complete.md` - Documentation

### Files Updated:
1. `src/lib/services/vertex-ai.service.ts` - Added search grounding method
2. `src/lib/services/genkit.service.ts` - Updated to use Vertex AI Search
3. `src/lib/services/orchestrator.service.ts` - Integrated presentation workflow

## Testing Instructions

### Test Vertex AI Search:
```bash
npm run test:vertex-search
```

### Test Presentation Formatting:
1. In the chat, request: "Create a presentation about [topic]"
2. Verify:
   - Title slide has no bullets
   - Each slide has exactly 3 bullets
   - Each bullet is 6 words or less
   - Content is keywords, not sentences

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor AI compliance** with formatting rules
2. **Gather user feedback** on the strict constraints
3. **Implement image generation** for presentation visuals
4. **Add presentation templates** for common use cases
5. **Create unit tests** for the presentation workflow

## Key Achievements

✅ Replaced Google Custom Search API with Vertex AI Search
✅ Implemented strict presentation formatting rules
✅ Created specialized presentation workflow with 7 agents
✅ Ensured slides are readable at a glance
✅ Added comprehensive documentation

## Notes

- The 3-bullet, 6-word rule is strict but ensures clarity
- Speaker notes contain the detailed content
- The formatter agent acts as a quality gate
- Vertex AI Search provides grounded, factual content
