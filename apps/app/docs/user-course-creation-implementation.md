# User Course Creation Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of user-generated course functionality, allowing users to create and manage their own courses (MVP - no sharing).

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Fixed TableRenderer Runtime Error
- **Issue**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')"
- **Solution**: Added defensive validation with optional chaining
- **File**: `src/components/chat/TableRenderer.tsx`
- **Change**: `data.rows?.length || 0`

### 2. API Updates for User Ownership

#### GET /api/lms/courses
- Added 'my-courses' type to filter by user ownership
- Filters courses by `createdBy` field matching authenticated user ID
- Returns only active courses owned by the user

#### PUT/DELETE /api/lms/courses/[courseId]
- Added ownership validation
- Returns 403 Forbidden if user doesn't own the course
- Ensures users can only modify their own courses

### 3. User Course Pages

#### My Courses Dashboard (`/courses/my-courses`)
- Lists all courses created by the current user
- Shows course statistics (modules, steps, enrollment)
- Provides quick actions (Edit, Preview, Delete)
- Uses Firebase authentication with `currentUser.getIdToken()`

#### Course Creation (`/courses/new`)
- Adapted from admin version for regular users
- Redirects to user edit page after creation
- Includes proper error handling and user feedback

#### Course Editor (`/courses/[courseId]/edit`)
- Full course editing capabilities
- Module and step management
- Tag management
- Publishing controls
- Ownership validation with 403 error handling

#### Course Preview (`/courses/[courseId]/preview`)
- Student view simulation
- Progress tracking
- Interactive module/step navigation
- Shows how the course will appear to learners

### 4. Navigation Updates
- Added "My Courses" under Learning section in sidebar
- Updated navigation structure to include submenu items

### 5. Type Updates
- Added optional `duration` fields for courses, modules, and steps
- Added `isLocked` property for step prerequisites
- Enhanced preview functionality support

## Security Features
- All endpoints validate user authentication
- Ownership validation on all modification operations
- Proper error messages for unauthorized access
- Automatic redirect on permission errors

## User Flow
1. User navigates to "My Courses" from sidebar
2. Clicks "Create New Course" button
3. Fills out course details and saves
4. Redirected to course editor
5. Adds modules and steps
6. Can preview course as student would see it
7. Publishes course when ready

## Next Steps
1. Test the complete personal course creation flow
2. Add course templates for quick start
3. Implement usage tracking and analytics
4. Create onboarding flow for new course creators
5. Add proper admin authentication (separate from user courses)

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Course sharing via unique links
- Public course marketplace
- Student reviews and ratings
- Monetization options for creators
- Course duplication/cloning
- Bulk import/export functionality
