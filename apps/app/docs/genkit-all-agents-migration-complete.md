# Genkit All Agents Migration Complete ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

All 35+ agents in the Mustard multi-agent orchestration system have been successfully migrated to use Google's Genkit framework. This provides a unified execution path with intelligent grounding capabilities.

## What Was Changed

### 1. TypeScript Configuration Fixed
- Updated `tsconfig.json` to resolve Node.js type definitions
- Added proper type roots and types configuration

### 2. Genkit Service Extended
- Added flows for all agent categories:
  - **Research Flow**: For research, biblical research, data analysis agents
  - **Critical Appraisal Flow**: For critical evaluation and theology analysis
  - **Data Analysis Flow**: For statistical and benchmark analysis
  - **Content Creation Flow**: For outline, introduction, body, conclusion writers
  - **Visual Design Flow**: For image generation, design, and slide layout
  - **Quality Enhancement Flow**: For editing, formatting, SEO, accessibility
  - **Domain Specific Flow**: For sermon, theology, youth, worship planning

### 3. Orchestrator Service Updated
- Removed the `groundingEnabledAgents` restriction
- All agents now route through Genkit by default
- Users can still disable grounding via preferences

## How Grounding Works

Each agent category uses Google Search intelligently:

### Research Agents
- **Always use search** for comprehensive research
- Multiple search queries for critical appraisal
- Benchmark searches for data analysis

### Content Agents
- **Conditionally use search** if they have research capabilities
- Search for examples and best practices when needed

### Visual Agents
- **Search for design inspiration** (except image-generator)
- Current trends and visual references

### Domain Agents
- **Search for domain-specific resources**
- Biblical/theological resources for theology agents
- Youth ministry ideas for youth specialists

### Quality Agents
- **Search for best practices** for SEO and accessibility
- No search for simple editing/formatting tasks

## Agent Categories

### Research (5 agents)
- General Research Agent
- Biblical Research Specialist
- Data Analysis Agent
- Source Validation Agent
- Critical Appraisal Specialist

### Content (11 agents)
- Outline Creator
- Introduction Specialist
- Body Content Writer
- Conclusion Specialist
- Title Generator
- Illustration Finder
- Discussion Question Creator
- Interactive Activity Designer
- Workbook Designer
- Leader Guide Creator

### Visual (4 agents)
- Image Generation Specialist
- Visual Design Consultant
- Infographic Designer
- Slide Design Specialist

### Domain (5 agents)
- Sermon Development Expert
- Theological Analysis Expert
- Youth Ministry Specialist
- Worship Service Planner
- Curriculum Design Specialist

### Quality (4 agents)
- Content Editor
- Format Specialist
- SEO Optimization Agent
- Accessibility Specialist

### Orchestrator (1 agent)
- Master Orchestrator (doesn't use grounding)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all agents are using Genkit:

```bash
npm run test:genkit-all-agents
```

Or directly:

```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/test-all-agents-genkit.ts
```

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Grounding

Users can control grounding through preferences:

```typescript
const result = await orchestratorService.orchestrate({
  userId: 'user-id',
  task: 'Your task here',
  preferences: {
    disableGrounding: true  // Set to true to disable grounding
  }
});
```

### Google Search API

To enable real Google Search (currently using mock data):

1. Get API credentials from Google Cloud Console
2. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=your-api-key
   GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your-engine-id
   ```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Architecture** - All agents use the same execution path
2. **Intelligent Grounding** - Search applied contextually
3. **Performance Optimized** - No unnecessary searches
4. **Fallback Support** - Automatic fallback to VertexAI
5. **User Control** - Grounding can be disabled
6. **Extensible** - Easy to add new flows and agents

## Next Steps

1. Add real Google Search API credentials
2. Monitor performance with all agents using Genkit
3. Fine-tune search queries for each agent type
4. Consider adding more specialized flows
5. Implement caching for search results

## Troubleshooting

### If agents aren't using Genkit:
1. Check that `disableGrounding` is not set to `true`
2. Verify the agent exists in the registry
3. Check console logs for fallback messages

### If search results are always mock data:
1. Ensure Google Search API credentials are set
2. Check API quota limits
3. Verify network connectivity
