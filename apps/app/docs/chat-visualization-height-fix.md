# Chat Visualization Height Fix

## Problem
Charts were not displaying in the chat interface despite the backend processing working correctly. The issue was identified in the ChartRenderer component where the height was being calculated as a percentage based on aspectRatio.

## Root Cause
The problematic code was:
```jsx
<div style={{ width: '100%', height: `${100 / aspectRatio}%`, minHeight: '300px' }}>
```

This calculated height as a percentage (e.g., `50%` when aspectRatio is 2), but percentage heights only work when the parent container has a defined height. Since the parent CardContent didn't have a fixed height, the chart container would collapse to 0 height, making the chart invisible.

## Solution
Fixed the height calculation by using a fixed pixel value:
```jsx
<div style={{ width: '100%', height: 400 }}>
```

This ensures the chart container always has a proper height of 400px, allowing the ResponsiveContainer and charts to render correctly.

## Files Modified
- `src/components/chat/ChartRenderer.tsx` - Fixed the height calculation in the chart container

## Testing
Created test script `src/scripts/test-chart-rendering-fix.ts` to verify:
1. AI generates chart visualizations with proper format
2. Parser extracts chart blocks correctly
3. Charts now render with fixed 400px height

## Result
Charts now display properly in the chat interface with a consistent height of 400px. The ResponsiveContainer correctly fills this space and renders the chart components.

## Future Considerations
If dynamic heights are needed in the future, consider:
1. Using CSS flexbox or grid for proper height inheritance
2. Calculating height based on viewport or container dimensions
3. Making height configurable through the ChartConfig interface
