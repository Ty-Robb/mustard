# AI Response Parser Fix Summary

## Issue
The text "Of course. This is an excellent and foundational question for understanding sin, responsibility, and relationships." was not appearing as the AI response above the green box. Additionally, the transition sentence "Here is a breakdown of why Adam was wrong to blame Eve..." was being included in the essay content.

## Solution
Updated the `ResponseParser` class in `src/lib/utils/response-parser.ts`:

1. **Fixed `findContentStart` method**: Modified to look for lines that start with transition phrases, allowing multi-sentence conversational parts before the transition.

2. **Enhanced transition sentence removal**: The parser now correctly removes transition sentences like "Here is a breakdown..." from the content while preserving the actual essay content.

## Test Results
Created test script `src/scripts/test-response-parser-fix.ts` which confirms:
- ✅ Conversational part correctly extracted
- ✅ Transition sentence successfully removed
- ✅ Content properly formatted with headers and paragraphs

## Impact
- AI responses now display correctly above the essay preview box
- Essay content is cleaner without redundant transition sentences
- Better separation between conversational AI responses and generated content
