# Visualization API Fix Summary

## Problem
The build was failing with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve 'child_process'
```

This occurred because the Vertex AI service (which uses Google Auth Library) was being imported into client-side components. The `child_process` module is a Node.js-specific module that doesn't exist in the browser environment.

## Root Cause
The error trace showed:
1. `EssayEditor.tsx` (client component) imports
2. `visualization-generator.ts` which imports  
3. `vertex-ai.service.ts` which uses `google-auth-library`
4. Google Auth Library tries to use `child_process` which is not available in the browser

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Server-Side API Route
Created `/api/visualizations/generate` route that:
- Handles authentication using Firebase Admin SDK
- Calls Vertex AI service on the server side
- Returns visualization data as JSON

### 2. Updated visualization-generator.ts
Modified the `generateVisualizationFromText` function to:
- Make HTTP requests to the API route instead of direct Vertex AI calls
- Handle authentication by getting the Firebase ID token
- Parse the API response

### 3. Kept Client-Side Logic
The following remain on the client side:
- Visualization detection logic (`detectVisualizationNeed`)
- Sample visualization generation (`generateSampleVisualization`)
- Chart and table rendering components

## Benefits
1. **Proper separation of concerns**: Server-side code stays on the server
2. **Security**: API keys and credentials are not exposed to the client
3. **Build compatibility**: No Node.js-specific modules in browser code
4. **Maintainability**: Clear API boundary between client and server

## Usage

### From Client Components
```typescript
import { generateVisualizationFromText } from '@/lib/utils/visualization-generator';

// Generate visualization from text
const visualization = await generateVisualizationFromText(
  "Show church growth over the last 5 years",
  'chart' // optional type preference
);

if (visualization) {
  // Insert into editor or render
  if (visualization.type === 'chart') {
    insertChartFromAI(editor, visualization.data, visualization.config);
  } else if (visualization.type === 'table') {
    insertDataTableFromAI(editor, visualization.data);
  }
}
```

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/visualizations/generate
Authorization: Bearer <firebase-id-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "The text to analyze",
  "type": "auto" | "chart" | "table" | "timeline" | "comparison"
}
```

## Testing
To test the visualization generation:
```bash
npx tsx src/scripts/test-editor-visualizations.ts
```

## Next Steps
1. Test the visualization generation in the editor
2. Implement automatic chart generation in AI responses
3. Add error handling and loading states in the UI
4. Consider caching frequently requested visualizations
