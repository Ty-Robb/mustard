# Vertex AI Search Implementation Status

## Summary

We attempted to implement Vertex AI Search (Google Search grounding) to replace the Google Custom Search API that was giving authentication errors. However, we encountered several issues with the implementation.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. Initial TypeScript Error
- **Error**: `'disableAttribution' does not exist in type 'GoogleSearchRetrieval'`
- **Fix Attempted**: Removed the `disableAttribution` property

### 2. API Field Name Error
- **Error**: `Unable to submit request because google_search_retrieval is not supported; please use google_search field instead`
- **Fix Attempted**: Changed from `googleSearchRetrieval` to `googleSearch`

### 3. Current TypeScript Error
- **Error**: `'googleSearch' does not exist in type 'Tool'`
- **Status**: The TypeScript types in the @google-cloud/vertexai package don't seem to support the search grounding feature

## Root Cause

The Vertex AI SDK for Node.js (@google-cloud/vertexai) appears to have incomplete or outdated TypeScript definitions that don't include the search grounding capabilities that are available in the API.

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Use Direct API Calls
Instead of using the SDK, make direct HTTP requests to the Vertex AI API with the correct tool configuration for search grounding.

### Option 2: Type Casting Workaround
Use TypeScript type assertions to bypass the type checking, though this is not ideal:
```typescript
tools: [
  {
    googleSearch: {},
  } as any,
],
```

### Option 3: Alternative Search Solutions
1. **Fix Google Custom Search API**: Investigate why the Custom Search API is returning 401 errors. The API key format looks unusual (starting with "AQ.").
2. **Use a different search provider**: Consider alternatives like Bing Search API or SerpAPI
3. **Mock search results**: For development/testing, continue using mock search results

### Option 4: Wait for SDK Update
The Vertex AI SDK may need to be updated to include proper TypeScript definitions for the search grounding feature.

## Current State

- The Genkit service falls back to mock search results when Vertex AI Search fails
- The application continues to work but without real web search capabilities
- Research agents can still function but with limited external data access

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Continue with mock search results for now
2. **Short-term**: Investigate the Google Custom Search API authentication issue
3. **Long-term**: Monitor Vertex AI SDK updates for proper search grounding support
