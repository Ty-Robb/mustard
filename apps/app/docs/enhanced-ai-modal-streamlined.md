# Enhanced AI Modal - Streamlined Implementation

## Overview
The AI modal has been streamlined to remove redundant formatting options and focus on AI-specific functionality with enhanced input controls for Bible-focused content creation.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Redundancies
- **Removed Formatting Tab**: All formatting controls are now exclusively in the selection toolbar's "Edit" dropdown
- **Removed Quick Actions Tab**: Merged essential features into the AI Assistant tab
- **Removed Mini Formatting Toolbar**: No longer needed since formatting is in the selection toolbar

### 2. Enhanced AI Controls
The modal now features a dedicated "AI Controls" tab with:

#### Custom Instructions
- Text area for specific instructions
- Placeholder example: "Make this suitable for a youth sermon with modern examples"

#### Bible-Focused Templates
- Sermon Outline
- Bible Study Guide
- Daily Devotional
- Biblical Commentary
- Add Cross-References

#### Tone Selection
- Devotional (Personal and reflective)
- Scholarly (Academic and analytical)
- Pastoral (Caring and encouraging)
- Evangelistic (Outreach focused)
- Teaching (Educational and clear)

#### Target Audience
- General Congregation
- Youth/Young Adults
- Children
- New Believers
- Mature Believers
- Seekers/Non-believers

#### Advanced Options
- Length preference (shorter/same/longer)
- Creativity level slider (0-1)
- Include Bible references toggle
- Context/background field

### 3. Improved AI Integration
- The `handleAIAction` function now accepts custom instructions
- Instructions are combined with base prompts for more targeted AI responses
- All AI controls feed into a unified instruction builder

## Component Structure

### EnhancedAIModal
- **AI Assistant Tab**: Shows AI suggestions and quick actions
- **AI Controls Tab**: All input controls for customizing AI behavior

### EditorSelectionToolbar
- **Edit Dropdown**: All formatting controls (bold, italic, headings, lists, etc.)
- **Enhance Dropdown**: All AI actions (enhance, expand, summarize, rephrase, ideas)

## Usage Flow

1. User selects text in the editor
2. Selection toolbar appears with Edit and Enhance options
3. User can:
   - Use Edit dropdown for immediate formatting
   - Use Enhance dropdown to trigger AI modal
4. In AI modal:
   - Switch to AI Controls tab to customize instructions
   - Use templates, tone, audience settings
   - Click AI action buttons to generate suggestions
5. Review and accept/reject AI suggestions

## Benefits

1. **No Redundancy**: Each feature has one clear location
2. **Focused UI**: Modal is purely for AI functionality
3. **Better Control**: Users have fine-grained control over AI output
4. **Bible-Specific**: Templates and tones are tailored for biblical content
5. **Accessibility**: Formatting controls remain accessible via selection toolbar

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Instructions Flow
```typescript
const handleAIAction = async (action: AIAction, text: string, customInstructions?: string) => {
  // Base prompts for each action
  const basePrompts = { /* ... */ };
  
  // Build full prompt with custom instructions
  let fullPrompt = basePrompts[action];
  if (customInstructions) {
    fullPrompt += `\n\nAdditional instructions: ${customInstructions}`;
  }
  fullPrompt += `\n\nText to process:\n"${text}"`;
  
  // Send to AI service...
};
```

### Instruction Builder
The `buildCustomInstructions()` function combines:
- Custom text instructions
- Selected tone and its description
- Target audience
- Length preference
- Bible reference preference
- Context/background information

## Future Enhancements

1. **Save Settings**: Allow users to save their preferred AI settings as defaults
2. **Custom Templates**: Let users create and save their own prompt templates
3. **AI Service Integration**: Connect to actual AI service (Vertex AI) for real suggestions
4. **History**: Track previous AI suggestions for reference
5. **Batch Processing**: Apply AI actions to multiple text selections
