# Bible Reader Scroll Fix Implementation

## Problem Description

The right panel in the Bible reader was not scrolling properly despite having `overflow-y-scroll` applied in the `SplitScreenLayout` component. The content would expand beyond the viewport without showing scrollbars.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by improper height constraints in the right panel structure:

```jsx
// Previous structure (not working)
<div className="relative h-full">
  <div className="p-6 pb-24">
    {/* content */}
  </div>
</div>
```

The inner div with padding had no height constraints, causing it to expand with its content rather than creating a scrollable area.

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Flexbox Layout Structure

Changed the parent container to use flexbox:

```jsx
<div className="relative h-full flex flex-col">
```

This ensures the container properly fills its allocated height and can distribute space to its children.

### 2. Flexible Content Area with Overflow

Made the content area flexible and added overflow handling:

```jsx
<div className="flex-1 overflow-y-auto custom-scrollbar p-6 pb-24">
```

- `flex-1`: Makes this div grow to fill available space
- `overflow-y-auto`: Enables vertical scrolling when content overflows
- `custom-scrollbar`: Applies custom scrollbar styling defined in globals.css

### 3. Button Positioning Fix

Changed floating buttons from `fixed` to `absolute`:

```jsx
<div className="absolute bottom-8 right-8 flex gap-2 z-10">
```

This keeps the navigation buttons within the panel container rather than fixed to the viewport.

## How It Works

1. **Height Constraint Chain**: 
   - The `SplitScreenLayout` provides a constrained height to each panel
   - The panel container (`h-full flex flex-col`) fills this height
   - The content area (`flex-1`) expands to fill remaining space after other elements

2. **Overflow Behavior**:
   - When content exceeds the available height, `overflow-y-auto` triggers
   - The custom scrollbar appears, styled according to the CSS rules

3. **Independent Scrolling**:
   - Each panel maintains its own scroll position
   - Scrolling in one panel doesn't affect the other

## Custom Scrollbar Styling

The scrollbars use custom CSS defined in `globals.css`:

```css
.custom-scrollbar {
  scrollbar-width: thin;
  scrollbar-color: #9ca3af #f3f4f6;
}

.custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 8px;
  height: 8px;
}
```

This provides:
- Thin scrollbars that don't take up much space
- Theme-aware colors (with dark mode support)
- Consistent appearance across browsers

## Key Principles

1. **Explicit Height Constraints**: Every scrollable container needs a defined height limit
2. **Flexbox for Dynamic Layouts**: Use flexbox to properly distribute available space
3. **Overflow at the Right Level**: Apply overflow properties to the actual content container
4. **Maintain Layout Hierarchy**: Ensure each level of the DOM properly constrains its children

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Load a Bible chapter with content that exceeds the viewport height
2. Confirm scrollbar appears in the right panel
3. Verify scrolling works smoothly
4. Check that left panel scrolls independently
5. Ensure navigation buttons remain visible and properly positioned
