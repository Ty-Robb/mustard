# Chat Preview and Essay Summary Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Chat Response Preview Not Showing from Beginning
**Problem**: When users sent a message, there was no immediate visual feedback. The response preview only appeared after the API started streaming.

**Solution**:
- Added `pendingUserMessage` state to the `useChat` hook to track messages immediately when sent
- Updated `ChatContainer` to display both the pending user message and an empty assistant message immediately
- Added visual indicators:
  - User message shows "Sending..." status
  - Assistant message shows 3 bouncing dots animation while waiting
  - Streaming content shows a pulsing cursor

**Files Modified**:
- `src/hooks/useChat.ts` - Added pendingUserMessage state and logging
- `src/components/chat/ChatContainer.tsx` - Added logic to show pending messages
- `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx` - Added visual indicators for pending/streaming states
- `src/app/(protected)/chat/page.tsx` - Passed pendingUserMessage to ChatContainer

### 2. Essay Summary Card Feature Re-enabled
**Problem**: The green-bordered essay summary card (shown in the user's image) was disabled, causing long-form content to clutter the chat interface.

**Solution**:
- Re-enabled the essay summary feature in ChatMessage component
- Updated the summary card styling to match the green-bordered design
- Enhanced ResponseAnalyzer to better detect presentation/plan content
- Summary card shows:
  - Green border and background
  - File icon
  - Word count
  - Content preview (first 150 characters)
  - "Click to open in editor" prompt

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx` - Re-enabled shouldShowSummary logic
- `src/components/chat/EssaySummary.tsx` - Updated styling with green theme
- `src/lib/utils/response-analyzer.ts` - Added presentation/plan detection keywords

### 3. Infinite Loop in ChatFAB Component
**Problem**: Maximum update depth exceeded error due to nested TooltipProvider components causing infinite re-renders.

**Solution**:
- Moved TooltipProvider to wrap the entire ChatFAB component
- Fixed the Tooltip component in the UI library to not create nested providers
- Removed redundant TooltipProvider instances

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/chat/ChatFAB.tsx` - Restructured to have single TooltipProvider
- `src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx` - Removed nested TooltipProvider from Tooltip component
