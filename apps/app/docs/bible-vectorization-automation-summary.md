# Bible Vectorization Automation Summary

## Date: August 29, 2025

### Major Improvements Implemented

#### 1. Master Vectorization Script ✅
Created `vectorize-all-books.ts` that:
- Processes all 66 books sequentially
- Tracks progress in `vectorization-progress.json`
- Supports safe interruption and resumption
- Uses theme data when available
- Falls back to basic metadata for books without themes

#### 2. Dynamic Delay System ✅
Implemented intelligent delays based on book size:
- **< 100 verses**: 2 minutes (e.g., Obadiah, Philemon, 2-3 John)
- **100-500 verses**: 5 minutes (most Minor Prophets and Epistles)
- **500-1000 verses**: 7 minutes (medium-sized books)
- **1000+ verses**: 10 minutes (major books like Genesis, Psalms)

This optimization saves approximately 8-10 hours compared to fixed 10-minute delays.

### Current Progress

**Books Completed**: 24/66 (36%)
**Verses Processed**: 19,179/31,102 (62%)
**Last Completed**: Daniel

### Time Estimates

With dynamic delays:
- Remaining 42 books: ~20-25 hours
- Previous estimate (fixed delays): ~30-35 hours
- **Time saved**: ~10 hours

### How to Run

```bash
# Run the master vectorization script
npm run vectorize-all

# Check current progress
npm run check-vector-stats

# Test setup before running
node src/scripts/run-tsx-with-env.js src/scripts/test-vectorize-all.ts
```

### Key Features

1. **Progress Tracking**: Automatically saves progress after each book
2. **Resume Capability**: Can be interrupted with Ctrl+C and resumed
3. **Error Handling**: Continues with next book if one fails
4. **Dynamic Delays**: Adjusts wait time based on book size
5. **Theme Support**: Uses detailed themes for Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Matthew

### Next Steps

1. Continue running the vectorization script
2. Monitor progress and API rate limits
3. Generate theme files for remaining books as needed
4. Optimize further if rate limits allow
