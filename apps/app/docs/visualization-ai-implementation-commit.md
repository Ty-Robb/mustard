# AI-Powered Visualization Implementation

## Commit Summary
Refactored visualization system to use AI-only generation, removing all hardcoded sample data

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed Sample Data Functions
- Deleted `generateSampleVisualization` from visualization-generator.ts
- Removed `insertSampleChart` from ChartNode.tsx  
- Removed `insertSampleTable` from DataTableNode.tsx
- Removed chart/table toolbar buttons that relied on sample data

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling & Logging
- Added comprehensive logging to /api/visualizations/generate route
- All logs prefixed with [Visualization API] for easy filtering
- Removed fallback to sample data on AI failures
- Added validation checks before inserting visualizations

### 3. Improved Node Defaults
- Changed default data/config from sample values to null
- Forces all visualizations to come from AI analysis

### 4. Updated Components
- EssayEditor now only uses AI generation
- TiptapEditor toolbar simplified
- All references to sample functions removed

## Benefits
- Ensures all visualizations are contextually relevant
- Better debugging with detailed logging
- Cleaner, more maintainable codebase
- No misleading placeholder data

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with various data types and the test scripts have been updated accordingly.

## Next Steps
- Monitor production logs to identify any remaining issues
- Test with real-world data like church attendance figures
- Consider adding more visualization types based on user needs
