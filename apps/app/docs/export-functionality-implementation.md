# Export Functionality Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the export functionality for the platform, allowing users to export their activity data, learning progress, and other information in various formats.

## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Components

1. **Export Types and Interfaces** (`src/types/export.ts`)
   - Defined export types, formats, and status enums
   - Created interfaces for export requests, jobs, and filters

2. **Export Service** (`src/lib/services/export.service.ts`)
   - Implemented without external dependencies (simplified version)
   - Supports JSON and CSV formats natively
   - PDF temporarily outputs as formatted text files
   - Handles asynchronous export processing with job tracking

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `POST /api/exports` - Create new export job
   - `GET /api/exports` - List user's export jobs
   - `GET /api/exports/[jobId]` - Get specific export job status

4. **Client Hook** (`src/hooks/useExport.ts`)
   - Provides easy-to-use interface for export operations
   - Handles authentication and error states
   - Supports polling for export job status

5. **UI Component** (`src/components/export/ExportDialog.tsx`)
   - User-friendly dialog for initiating exports
   - Real-time status updates with progress tracking
   - Download functionality for completed exports

6. **Integration**
   - Added ExportDialog to ActivityTracker component
   - Users can now export their activity data from the dashboard

### ðŸš§ Currently Implemented Export Types

1. **Activity History** âœ…
   - Exports all user activities with timestamps and metadata
   - Formats: CSV, JSON

2. **Activity Statistics** âœ…
   - Exports aggregated stats (total activities, streaks, etc.)
   - Formats: CSV, JSON

3. **Contribution Graph Data** âœ…
   - Exports daily activity counts for heatmap visualization
   - Formats: CSV, JSON

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Export Types

1. **Course Progress**
   - Will export course completion status, quiz scores, etc.
   - Requires integration with LMS service

2. **Quiz Results**
   - Detailed quiz performance data
   - Requires integration with quiz service

3. **Bible Highlights**
   - User's highlighted verses and notes
   - Requires integration with Bible service

4. **Payment History**
   - Transaction records and invoices
   - Requires integration with payment service

## Technical Details

### Export Process Flow

1. User selects export type and format in the UI
2. Frontend sends POST request to `/api/exports`
3. Backend creates export job with PENDING status
4. Export service processes data asynchronously:
   - Fetches relevant data based on export type
   - Formats data according to selected format
   - Stores result (currently as base64 data URL)
   - Updates job status to COMPLETED or FAILED
5. Frontend polls for job status updates
6. User downloads completed export

### Data Storage

Currently, exports are stored as base64 data URLs in MongoDB. In production, this should be replaced with cloud storage (S3, GCS, etc.) for better scalability.

### Security Considerations

- All export endpoints require authentication
- Users can only access their own export jobs
- Export jobs expire after 24 hours

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add External Dependencies**
   - Install and integrate `jspdf` for proper PDF generation
   - Install and integrate `xlsx` for native Excel support
   - Install `json2csv` for more robust CSV handling

2. **Cloud Storage Integration**
   - Replace base64 data URLs with cloud storage
   - Implement signed URLs for secure downloads
   - Add automatic cleanup of expired exports

3. **Additional Export Types**
   - Implement remaining export types (courses, quizzes, Bible data, payments)
   - Add "All Data" export option for GDPR compliance

4. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add date range filters for exports
   - Support custom field selection
   - Add export scheduling/automation
   - Email notifications when exports are ready

## Usage Example

```typescript
// In a React component
import { ExportDialog } from '@/components/export/ExportDialog';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Dashboard</h1>
      <ExportDialog />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing

To test the export functionality:

1. Navigate to the dashboard
2. Look for the "Export Data" button in the Activity Tracker card
3. Select an export type (Activity History, Stats, or Contribution Graph)
4. Choose a format (CSV or JSON)
5. Click "Start Export"
6. Wait for the export to complete
7. Click "Download" to save the file

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Export stays in PROCESSING state**
   - Check server logs for errors
   - Verify MongoDB connection
   - Ensure activity data exists for the user

2. **Download fails**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the download URL is valid
   - Try a different browser

3. **Missing data in exports**
   - Ensure user has activity data
   - Check date filters if applicable
   - Verify data fetching logic in export service
