# Editor Preview and Presentation Button Implementation - Complete

## Summary
This document summarizes the completed implementation of fixing the EditorPreview card content and adding the "Make Presentation" button.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. EditorPreview Content Fix
**File**: `src/components/chat/EditorPreview.tsx`

The EditorPreview card now shows meaningful content structure descriptions instead of duplicating the executive summary:

- **Before**: Showed the same executive summary text as the main response
- **After**: Shows contextual descriptions based on content type and user's question

#### Examples of New Descriptions:
- For definitions: "In-depth exploration of [topic] with biblical context and practical applications"
- For guides: "Step-by-step guide with practical instructions and clear progression"
- For essays: "Detailed guide covering [topics] with scriptural support"
- For lists: "Key principles and insights for deeper understanding and application"

#### Key Functions Added:
- `generateContentStructureDescription()`: Creates meaningful descriptions based on content analysis
- `extractTopicFromQuestion()`: Extracts the main topic from user's question
- `detectListType()`: Determines if a list contains steps, principles, or general items

### 2. Make Presentation Button
**File**: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`

Added a third action button that converts regular content into presentation format:

```tsx
<Button
  size="sm"
  variant="ghost"
  onClick={handleMakePresentation}
  className="h-7 px-2"
>
  <Presentation className="h-3 w-3" />
  <span className="ml-1 text-xs">
    Make Presentation
  </span>
</Button>
```

#### Functionality:
- Appears alongside "Copy" and "Open in Editor" buttons
- Only shows for editor-worthy content
- Converts content into slide format with:
  - Title slide from main heading
  - Content slides from sections/headers
  - Bullet points from paragraphs
  - Conclusion slide with key takeaways

### 3. UI Stability During Streaming
**File**: `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`

Fixed content jumping and raw tag display during streaming:

- **Before**: Raw content tags ([SUMMARY], [CONTENT], JSON) were visible during streaming
- **After**: Shows clean loading animations and stable UI structure

#### Key Improvements:
- Early detection of editor-worthy content
- Stable UI structure that persists throughout streaming
- ShimmerCard loading animations instead of raw content
- Smooth transition from loading to final content

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Test EditorPreview descriptions**:
   - Ask questions that generate long-form content
   - Verify the preview card shows meaningful descriptions, not the executive summary
   - Check that descriptions match the content type (definition, guide, essay, etc.)

2. **Test Make Presentation button**:
   - Generate editor-worthy content
   - Click "Make Presentation" button
   - Verify it opens in editor with slide format
   - Check that slides are properly structured

3. **Test streaming stability**:
   - Ask a question that generates long content
   - Observe that no raw tags appear during streaming
   - Verify UI doesn't jump or reorganize during generation
