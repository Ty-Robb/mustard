# Vertex AI Authentication Fix

## Issue
The chat feature was failing with authentication errors because the Google Cloud/Vertex AI credentials were not properly configured. MongoDB was working correctly, but the AI chat responses were failing due to missing authentication.

## Root Cause
- The `.env.local` file had a placeholder path for `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
- No actual Google Cloud service account key file was present
- The Vertex AI service couldn't authenticate to generate AI responses

## Solution

### 1. Local Development Setup
1. Created a Google Cloud service account with Vertex AI permissions
2. Downloaded the service account key JSON file
3. Moved it to `credentials/vertex-ai-key.json`
4. Updated `.env.local` to point to the correct path:
   ```
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=credentials/vertex-ai-key.json
   ```

### 2. Production (Vercel) Setup
1. Generated base64-encoded version of the service account key
2. Added to Vercel environment variables:
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: [base64-encoded key]
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID`: mustard-seed-db
   - `GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION`: us-central1

### 3. Security Considerations
- Added `credentials/` to `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files
- The service account key should never be committed to the repository
- Use environment variables for production deployments

## Verification
Run the test script to verify configuration:
```bash
pnpm tsx src/scripts/test-vertex-ai-config.ts
```

Expected output:
- ✅ File exists
- ✅ Vertex AI Service is initialized and available
- List of available AI agents

## Service Account Details
- Project ID: mustard-seed-db
- Service Account: vertex-ai-mustard@mustard-seed-db.iam.gserviceaccount.com
- Required permissions: Vertex AI User role
