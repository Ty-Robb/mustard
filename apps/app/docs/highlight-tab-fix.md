# Highlight Tab Fix - Manual Highlights Not Showing

## Problem
Manual highlights were being displayed correctly in the Bible text but were not showing up in the Highlights tab. The issue was that highlights were saved with references like "1JN.1.5" but the Highlights tab was querying with references like "1 John 1".

## Root Cause
The reference format mismatch between:
- **Saved highlights**: Using Bible API format (e.g., "1JN.1.5", "GEN.1.1")
- **Query reference**: Using human-readable format (e.g., "1 John 1", "Genesis 1")

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Reference Matching in highlights.service.ts
Updated the `getHighlightsByReference` method to handle multiple reference formats:

```typescript
// Handle numbered books (1 John, 2 Kings, etc.)
const numberedBookMatch = bookName.match(/^(\d)\s*(.+)$/);
if (numberedBookMatch) {
  const [, number, name] = numberedBookMatch;
  // Create patterns like "1JN", "1JO", "1JOHN"
  bookPatterns.push(`${number}${name.substring(0, 2).toUpperCase()}`);
  bookPatterns.push(`${number}${name.substring(0, 3).toUpperCase()}`);
  bookPatterns.push(`${number}${name.toUpperCase()}`);
}
```

### 2. Multiple Query Patterns
The service now searches for highlights using multiple patterns:
- `^1JN\.1\.` - Matches "1JN.1.5", "1JN.1.6"
- `^1JO\.1\.` - Alternative abbreviation
- `^1JOHN\.1\.` - Full book name in caps
- `^1 John\s+1:` - Human-readable with colon
- `^1 John\s+1\.` - Human-readable with period

### 3. Debug Logging
Added console logging to track:
- What reference is being searched
- How many highlights are found
- Sample of found highlights

## Testing
Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- `test-highlight-matching.ts` - TypeScript test with full service integration
- `test-highlight-matching-simple.js` - Simple Node.js test for MongoDB queries

## Result
Manual highlights now appear correctly in the Highlights tab alongside AI-generated highlights.

## Future Improvements
1. Consider standardizing reference formats across the application
2. Add a reference normalization utility function
3. Create indexes on the reference field for better query performance
