# Presentation Builder Implementation

## Overview

The presentation builder feature allows users to create, edit, and manage presentations directly within the chat interface. When users request a presentation, the system automatically opens a dedicated presentation builder in the right panel, similar to how essays are handled.

## Key Components

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/presentation.ts`)
- **Presentation**: Main presentation structure with slides, theme, and metadata
- **Slide**: Individual slide with layout and content
- **SlideLayout**: Various slide templates (title, content, two-column, image, chart, table, quote, blank)
- **PresentationTheme**: Styling configuration for presentations

### 2. Response Detection (`src/lib/utils/response-analyzer.ts`)
- Added presentation-specific keywords: "presentation", "slides", "slide deck", "powerpoint", "keynote", "pitch deck"
- Added presentation patterns for detecting user requests
- Enhanced `analyzeStreamingContent()` to detect presentations early
- New `isPresentationWorthy` flag in response analysis

### 3. TipTap Extensions (`src/components/editor/extensions/SlideNode.tsx`)
- **SlideNode**: Custom node for rendering individual slides in the editor
- **SlideBreak**: Mark for separating slides
- **insertSlideFromAI**: Helper function to insert AI-generated slides

### 4. Presentation Builder Component (`src/components/presentation/PresentationBuilder.tsx`)
- Main UI for creating and editing presentations
- Slide navigation sidebar with thumbnails
- TipTap editor integration for content editing
- Slide management (add, delete, reorder)
- AI content parsing to convert text into slides
- Save functionality

### 5. Chat Integration (`src/app/(protected)/chat/page.tsx`)
- Detects presentation requests during streaming
- Opens PresentationBuilder instead of EssayEditor when appropriate
- Handles switching between essay and presentation modes
- Maintains state for active presentation messages

## User Flow

1. **User Request**: User types "Create a presentation about [topic]"
2. **Detection**: ResponseAnalyzer detects presentation intent
3. **Auto-Open**: PresentationBuilder opens in right panel during streaming
4. **Content Parsing**: AI response is parsed into slide structure
5. **Editing**: User can edit, add, or remove slides
6. **Save**: Presentation can be saved for later use

## AI Content Format

The AI generates presentations in this format:
```markdown
# Presentation Title

## Slide 1: Title
- Bullet point 1
- Bullet point 2
- Bullet point 3

## Slide 2: Another Title
Content for this slide...

> "Quote for a quote slide" - Author
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
- `src/scripts/test-presentation-detection.ts`: Tests presentation detection logic
  - User prompt analysis
  - Streaming content detection
  - Full response analysis
  - 100% test pass rate

### Manual Testing
- `src/app/(protected)/test-presentation-builder/page.tsx`: Test page for manual testing
  - Empty presentation creation
  - AI content parsing
  - Save/load functionality
  - Various slide layouts

## Usage Examples

### Direct Presentation Request
```
User: "Create a presentation about renewable energy"
AI: [Opens presentation builder with slides about renewable energy]
```

### Content Transformation
```
User: "Write an essay about climate change"
AI: [Opens essay editor]
User: "Now turn this into a presentation"
AI: [Converts essay to presentation format and opens presentation builder]
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Functionality**
   - PDF export
   - PowerPoint export
   - HTML export

2. **Presentation Mode**
   - Full-screen presenter view
   - Speaker notes
   - Navigation controls

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Theme customization
   - Image/media insertion
   - Chart/table integration
   - Animations and transitions

4. **Collaboration**
   - Share presentations
   - Real-time collaboration
   - Comments and feedback

## Technical Considerations

- The presentation builder uses the same TipTap editor as the essay editor
- Slide content is stored in a structured format for easy manipulation
- The component is fully responsive and works with dark/light themes
- Performance is optimized for presentations with many slides
