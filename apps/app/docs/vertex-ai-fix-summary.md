# Vertex AI Initialization Fix Summary

## Problem
The chat API was throwing a 500 error with the message:
```
Error [IllegalArgumentError]: [VertexAI.IllegalArgumentError]: Unable to infer your project.
```

This was happening because the VertexAI service was trying to initialize without the required Google Cloud configuration.

## Root Cause
1. The `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID` environment variable was not set in `.env.local`
2. The VertexAI service constructor was not handling missing configuration gracefully
3. The service would throw an error during initialization, causing the entire chat API to fail

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Google Cloud Configuration to `.env.local`
```env
# Google Cloud Vertex AI Configuration
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID=pipit-776ui
GOOGLE_CLOUD_REGION=us-central1
```

### 2. Modified VertexAI Service for Graceful Degradation
- Added initialization checks and error handling
- Made the service return empty arrays when not properly configured
- Added `isAvailable()` and `getInitializationError()` methods for status checking
- Service now logs warnings instead of throwing errors when configuration is missing

### 3. Key Changes to `vertex-ai.service.ts`
- Made `vertexAI`, `auth`, and `config` nullable
- Added `isInitialized` flag and `initializationError` tracking
- Wrapped initialization in try-catch blocks
- Modified all public methods to check availability before proceeding

## Result
- ✅ Chat API no longer crashes when Vertex AI is not fully configured
- ✅ Other AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) work normally
- ✅ Vertex AI agents are shown in the UI but require authentication to use
- ✅ Service provides clear error messages when Vertex AI features are accessed without proper auth

## Next Steps
To fully enable Vertex AI functionality:
1. Create a Google Cloud service account with Vertex AI permissions
2. Download the service account key JSON file
3. Add one of these to `.env.local`:
   - For local dev: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/key.json`
   - For production: `GOOGLE_CLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=base64-encoded-json`

## Testing
The fix was verified using the test script at `src/scripts/test-chat-api-fix.ts` which confirmed:
- Vertex AI service initializes successfully
- All 4 Vertex AI agents are available
- Chat service includes both regular and Vertex AI agents (8 total)
